    DonorsChoose engages the public in public schools by giving people a simple, accountable, and personal way to address educational inequity. In this clip, board member Stephen Colbert tells our story.
    
   
  
   To date, teachers at 83% of all the public schools in America have posted classroom project requests on our site. Projects range from paper and markers for a poetry writing unit to violins for a school recital. More than 4 million ""citizen philanthropists"" have supported such projects, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 40 million students nationwide. In all, we've generated $1 billion for learning experiences designed by our country's most dedicated public school teachers. 
    GOOD Magazine highlighted us as one of 30 Places We Want to Work, while Fast Company named DonorsChoose one of the 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World—the first time a charity has made this list. Through its dedicated team and culture, DonorsChoose earned recognition as the #1 ""Best Nonprofit to Work For"" by the Nonprofit Times. 
   
  Team Overview 
   As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose you'll answer between 60 - 100 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles. 
   You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth grade science class. And sometimes you'll have to do things like explain policies that won't make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It's not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day you'll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students! 
   In addition to this core work, sometimes you'll be assigned capacity building work as workload and time allows. This capacity-building work is defined as work that executes against a CS manager's OKRs and will be done in close collaboration with your manager, who will fully scope and define the work. This work could look like: 
  Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders. 
   Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets. 
   Update or write public-facing help content. 
   Hop on the phone to resolve a particularly gnarly issue. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it's just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!) 
   Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization. 
   Update our internal training decks or be asked to facilitate a session. 
   Add information into our knowledge management system 
   Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization. 
  The majority of your time will be dedicated to core ticket work. When time, performance, workload, and need allow, capacity-building work may be matched with you. The breakdown between core ticket work and capacity building work for a Specialist will vary as our volume fluctuates. Typically, we estimate that you can expect this breakdown of work: 
   Q1+Q2: 95% core ticket work, 5% capacity-building work 
   Q3: 90% core ticket work, 10% capacity-building work 
   Q4: 80% core ticket work, 20% capacity-building work 
   Qualifications 
  Professional. You are the face of DonorsChoose to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, productive, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don't require a ton of supervision. 
   A solid communicator. It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You will also use these skills to engage with our customers on our Equity Focus when they reach out to us. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone. 
   Thoughtful. You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think ""What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?"" You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information. 
   Productive. We have high expectations for the quantity of work that you will do each day, while maintaining an excellent quality of support. 
   Tech comfy. You'll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques. 
   A learner. You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers. This makes you flexible to change and open to feedback on your work. 
   Decisive. You'll make judgement calls and decisions based on your knowledge of our policies and processes. You have a bias toward action. You recognize you might make mistakes or occasionally say the wrong thing to a customer, but are confident in your ability to own mistakes and learn from them. 
   Resourceful. Not every question has an easy answer, but you're totally into figuring things out. You've used multiple methods to investigate and successfully discovered the answer to something tricky. (And you'll be able to tell us about this in an interview!) 
   Generous. Once you figure something out, you're excited to share the new information. You want to lend your ideas to the team and make everyone around you stronger. 
  You might also be: (not required, but let us know if this is you!) 
  A customer support pro. You already have experience providing customer support and genuinely enjoy working with people to solve problems. You're interested in a career in customer support and contributing to projects that directly impact the culture and effectiveness of Customer Support at DonorsChoose. 
   Interested in crowdfunding platforms, two-sided marketplaces, or K-12 Education. 
   A seasoned work-from-home pro. Or, in the least, committed to and eager to try it out.

 Code Galaxy provides structure and guidance in a fun yet challenging collaborative environment.

The online program provides access and flexibility to launch kids ahead with the skills and habits of mind needed in the age of technology.

     Column is looking to hire a full-time

    What You'll Do 
    First Week: You will learn about Column's mission and vision, seek to understand our product, design, and engineering processes, and begin meeting other folks on the team. We're a small company that's growing quickly, so interpersonal rapport is essential. 
     First Month: You will build out the initial structures of a design system. You will transform a product requirement document into a finalized design spec and collaborate with engineers to ship the final designs. 
     First Six Months: You will ship production-ready designs across all areas of our core product.

     You're excited to have exceptional ownership over the future of interface design at Column and embrace the fact that being the first designer on means that you will have little day-to-day guidance, support, or feedback from other designers

     You're familiar with web-first design practices, care about designing for accessibility, and have created and/or owned a design library

         COVID-19 Immunization Requirement
         
        Under Policy 60.1.35, Rutgers University requires all prospective employees to provide proof that they are fully vaccinated and have received a booster (where eligible) against COVID-19 prior to commencement of employment, unless the University has granted the individual a medical or religious exemption. Prospective employees who are not eligible for a booster at the time of an offer of employment must provide proof they have received a booster within two weeks (14 calendar days) of eligibility. Based on current guidance, individuals are considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19 two weeks after receiving the final dose of any COVID-19 vaccine authorized or approved for use in the United States by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Eligibility for a booster against COVID-19 varies and is explained on the University’s web site located at https://coronavirus.rutgers.edu/covid-19-vaccine. Failure to provide proof of primary vaccination and booster will result in rescission of a prospective employee’s offer of employment and/or disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Whether working on our cloud systems, researching the latest in computer technology or keeping Google's internal systems humming, Googlers and users alike rely on us to keep things running.

   This is a hybrid position. There are flexible work from home options available. A member of our recruitment team will discuss the options with you in more detail.
  
   MUFG is the fifth largest bank in the world (in total assets), with a 360-year heritage steeped in capital markets and wholesale banking. Since the global bank's expansion into the United States 150 years ago, MUFG Americas has served America's retail, corporate and investment banking clients and customers. With plans to divest its retail banking proposition, Union Bank, to U.S. Bancorp in 2022, MUFG Americas will emerge as a leading financial services institution with a substantial footprint in North America and renewed focus and investment on its core products in corporate and investment banking.
  
   During this significant divestiture activity, MUFG Americas seeks to recruit a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to lead information security as the bank advances its technology modernization efforts and contends with an increasingly complex threat environment as well as regulatory landscape.
  
   Given the confluence of these critical priorities, there is a need for a seasoned CISO, who can collaborate with business and technology stakeholders to mature the information security program in support of evolving business needs in a dynamic technology environment. The CISO will translate the bank's priorities into a comprehensive information security strategy to protect the data and assets of the bank and its customers, while enabling business innovation and growth.
  
   The incoming CISO will be focused on the future potential of the business to set the strategy and lead the delivery of a world-class cybersecurity capability in collaboration with technology, risk, and business leadership. Successful candidates will position cybersecurity as a thought-partner and business enabler, while upholding the highest standard of security and compliance to protect the data and information assets of the bank and its clients.
  
   Key Responsibilities: 
  
  The CISO of MUFG Americas will have ultimate accountability and ownership for information security as it relates to MUFG America's business, as well as the secure divestiture of Union Bank to US Bancorp. Amongst other functional and leadership responsibilities, the CISO will:
  
   Assess the current state cyber organization including people, processes, and technology. Establish a strategic road map based on prioritized areas of risk to evolve the bank's information security posture from reactive to proactive. Implement target milestones and metrics to measure performance. Communicate progress, roadblocks and challenges to the board and key stakeholders.
    Update and educate the board of directors and executive team on current cyber threats, issues, and risks; provide regular status updates on initiatives and operations.
    Engage and align with technology and business partners to drive a comprehensive information security strategy and ensure information assets and technologies are appropriately protected.
    Support the overall business technology planning, providing a current knowledge and future vision of technology, systems, data and how to ensure a secure environment.
    Collaborate across business lines; empowering business leaders to take ownership and accountability for risk appetite within respective businesses, and necessary information security practices to ensure protection of business activities.
    As the bank continues their migration to the public cloud, partner with technology to implement modern security standards, specifically related to application development and delivery.
    Lead all engineering activities pertaining to the design and implementation of cybersecurity solutions, including the development and maintenance of tools, technology, and processes.
    Drive adoption and optimization of cyber tool sets for a streamlined user experience – implement appropriate controls while identifying opportunity for automation across the stack.
    As needed, provide due diligence and support for M&A activity, assess new companies and potential acquisitions for eventual onboarding as well as support streamlined divestiture activity.
    Own and continuously evolve third-party risk management practices including a formal process and framework to assess vendors, service providers and solutions to mitigate third-party risk.
    Maintain relationships and connectivity to industry peers and relevant ""three letter agencies"" to collaborate, share information and stay abreast of cyber events or topics that may impact the bank.
    Serve as a thought leader both within the bank and externally by maintaining a relentless focus on staying ahead of trends in a dynamic cyber environment.
    Develop, mentor, and manage a motivated staff of information security professionals, including hiring, training, development, and performance management.
    Recruit, lead and inspire a diverse, world-class cybersecurity team.
  
   Desired Outcomes:
   The remediation and resolution of high priority regulatory issues.
    Lead the CISO function, ensuring continuous operational stability of MUFG Americas in support of the successful, secure divestiture of Union Bank to US Bancorp.
    A long-term road map focused on the delivery of a world-class, modern information security program, with metrics to measure progress over time.
    Resiliency - not only protection of data and assets of the bank and its customers, but more importantly the ability to recover and rebuild the program in the event of cyberattack.
    The evolution of the bank's cybersecurity posture from defensive to offensive and industry leading.
  
   Qualifications:
  
   The successful candidate will have transformed and led modern cybersecurity environments in highly regulated environments, without stifling innovation or business growth. They will be skilled at influencing across the enterprise, rapidly building credibility with the board, regulators, and regional and global leadership.

   About the role
   As a pivotal member of the team, you will lead strategy decisions, technical plans, agile ceremonies, requirement gathering from internal and external partners, cross-org collaboration, project execution, and product launches.
  
   We value writing high-quality code on top of robust architecture. Our products are increasingly complex, API-driven, and built on the latest technologies. We work at all layers of our applications, from the networking stack to the UI layers within other Zillow Group’s products as an embedded solution. We take pride in intimately understanding the technical requirements and architecture of our supported teams and customers, and serve as allies during integration, iteration, and mutual feature development.

Maturity, high judgment, skills, ability to influence, analytical talent, and leadership are critical to success in this role.

    3+ years of hands-on experience building software solutions within current industry standard technologies
    2+ years of experience leading dev teams to design/architect business software solutions
    A first-hand solid understanding of current mobile development technologies
    Sophisticated knowledge of business applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel and current project management tools
    Excellent oral and written communication skills, as well as the ability to think clearly, analyze quantitatively, problem-solve, scope technical requirements and prioritize tasks
    Strong business and technical vision
    Ability to balance multiple competing priorities in a fast-paced environment
    A deep understanding of software development in a team, and a track record of shipping software on time
    Outstanding customer relationship skills including the ability to discover the true requirements underlying feature requests, recommend alternative technical and business approaches

Work Location
Home Based
Expected duration

Duties and Responsibilities
Background:
The United Nations Development Coordination Office (DCO) serves as the secretariat for the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) – 40 agencies, funds and programmes working on sustainable development - at the regional and global levels. DCO provides substantive guidance and support to UN Resident Coordinators (RCs) and United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs), in addition to daily backstopping to Resident Coordinator Offices (RCOs) on the ground. DCO acts as a key conduit for supporting the UN’s activities for sustainable development, which inform policy, programme and operations on the ground.

With the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 72/279 that led to the delinking of the RCS from UNDP to the Secretariat, the Business Management Branch (BMB) HR unit of DCO has had the priority to staff each RCO with the core positions to deliver the new coordination functions envisioned in the Secretary-General reform agenda. As we enter the third year of operation there is now a need to identify the career avenues and bridges for the RCO staff to ensure we continue to retain them, but also attract new talent while offering career perspective to those already onboard. Reliant on the country context and needs, the grade level of the core RCO functions vary from NOA to NOD and P-3 to P-5. The success of the repositioning of the Resident Coordination System depends without doubt, on the Resident Coordinator leadership supported by a strong, efficient and motivated RCO. The establishment of the resident coordinator function, the Development Coordination Office and the enlarged resident coordinator offices, with hundreds of posts under United Nations Secretariat contracts, highlights the need for an agile career framework, strongly anchored in the inter-agency and inter-entity mobility mechanisms.

DCO Career framework calls for a multi-prong approach to career and learning opportunities for its RCO staff and seeks to produce several career support products that that will ensure the RC System is an employer of choice that provides agile careers to all its staff.
Scope of Work:
The Consultant will work closely with the DCO-BMB HR, and related counterparts, to support the implementation of RCO Career and Learning Frameworks as well as develop RCO Learning Journeys for the thematic core functions of the Resident Coordinator Offices.
The consultants will undertake a comprehensive mapping and review and develop a repository of Learning opportunities (Learning Journeys).
The consultant will develop the tool kit in line with the Career and Staff Development Framework. The toolkit will provide clear career paths, career programmes and will include the necessary instruments and learning journeys required to support career growth.

 We're looking for a game developer who can help us develop a custom Photobooth application. We don't have a preferred game engine, we leave that up to the developer.
 The basic gist of the game is as follows:
 User starts the game in a standing position in front of a camera (hardware to be recommended by game developer)
  User poses while the camera does facial recognition and records their face for a predetermined number of seconds
  User's face is placed on top of the face of a predetermined video. Essentially replacing the face of a character in the provided short video-clip.
 We have at least 2 other game ideas that would use the same fundamentals described here. If we're satisfied with the work relationship and game performance, we would love to continue the partnership on future projects

  Sound Designer for AAA game studio based in NYC
   Avalanche Studios is seeking a Sound Designer (SD) with heart, to join the audio team on our latest AAA project, Contraband. Challenges include working with proprietary tools including the Apex game engine and our own modular audio framework, and utilizing these tools along with the Wwise audio engine to design and implement sounds into our game in a fairly unique way. 
  By joining our team of audio developers, you’ll be taking on the responsibility of giving weight and size to the worlds our games take place in. Our ideal team member will have a healthy balance of creative and technical problem solving abilities, as both will be needed for the role. Half of a game’s audio quality is determined by implementation, and as an Avalanche Sound Designer you’ll be responsible for both creating and implementing your own sounds.
   We rely upon our Sound Designers to:
  Utilize their talents in crafting unique sounds to give depth, weight and character to our beautiful open worlds. 
   Think abstractly about sound sources and design their sounds using a combination of field recordings, synthesized sounds, and sounds from our extensive library. 
   Collaborate with team members across disciplines to find solutions that best support quality audio. 
   Playtest regularly and help identify opportunities to improve audio quality. 
   Embrace the challenge of problem solving with proprietary tools and applications that lack the polish and limitations that come with off-the-shelf solutions
  
  Skills and experience we’re interested in:
  Experience as a sound designer 
   Wwise fluency 
   DAW proficiency (Reaper is the team’s DAW of choice) 
   Ability to give and accept feedback 
   Communicating with people across large development teams 
   Musical knowledge and a vision for interactive music is a plus! 
   Experience with any scripting language is a plus!
