     Every morning, 10,000 Americans wake up and begin their first day of retirement. For these older Americans, determining how they manage healthcare during this period of their lives will be critical. For most, this will involve navigating Medicare (healthcare coverage for retirees over 65).
   
   
   
     Yet, the process of navigating Medicare is arduous and complex. There are over 20,000 permutations of Medicare plans in the U.S., and choosing the wrong plans at the wrong time can result in penalties, exorbitant healthcare costs, or insufficient coverage.
   
   
   
     Chapter exists to reinvent the way Americans transition into retirement, starting with Medicare.
   
   
   
     Our team has built industry-leading, proprietary technology that helps retirees easily and effectively navigate Medicare to fulfill a simple promise: 
    Help retirees find the best health coverage to meet their needs while reducing what they pay for it.

If you are looking to develop a long and satisfying career, surrounded by a supportive team, this is the place for you.
 Production managers plan, coordinate, and control manufacturing processes so that products are delivered on time and within budget
 As a Production Manager, you'll make sure goods and services are produced safely, cost-effectively and on time and that they meet the required quality standards.
 The scope of the job depends on the nature of the production system. Many companies are involved in several types of production, adding to the complexity of the role. It's likely that you will be responsible for both human and material resources.
 Responsibilities
 As a production manager, you'll oversee the production process, coordinating all production activities and operations. You'll need to:
 Plan and draw up a production schedule
  Decide on and order the resources that are required and ensure stock levels remain adequate
  Select equipment and take responsibility for its maintenance
  Set the quality standards
  Ensure that the production will be cost effective by estimating costs and negotiating and agreeing budgets with both clients and managers
  Monitor the production processes and adjust schedules as needed
  Monitor productivity rates and product standards and implement quality control programs
  Organize the repair of any damaged equipment
  Liaise with different departments, teams and companies, e.g. suppliers, managers, clients

  Work with managers to implement the company's policies and goals
  Collate and analyze data, putting together production reports for both factory managers and customers
  Supervise and motivate a team of workers
  Review worker performance and identify training needs.
 You'll be involved in the pre-production (planning) stage as well as the production (control and supervision) stage. A large part of the job is dealing with people and resource management.
 You may also be involved with product design and purchasing. In some larger firms, planners, controllers and production engineers and supervisors will assist you. The role may be integrated with other functions, such as marketing, sales and finance.
 Working hours
 You can expect to work around 40 hours per week. The role may involve shift work and unsocial hours to make sure there's cover throughout the production process. Extended hours may be required to meet deadlines or to introduce new systems. You could be on call at weekends or public holidays to deal with problems.
 What to expect
 You'll spend considerable amounts of time on the shop floor supervising staff.
  Dress code is usually business casual, but you'll need to dress more formally when meeting suppliers, managers or business people.
  You may need to travel between sites during the day and spend time away from home.

 Do you believe in good korma? Do samosas give you all the fillings? If you take efficient growth, spreadsheets and food seriously, but not yourself (and you enjoy a good pun), then we might have a job for you.
 First, a little more about us. We are Deep Indian Kitchen®. You may have seen us in the frozen aisles of over 9,000 natural and conventional grocery stores or been to our chain of 3 fast-casual restaurants in NYC. Or, if you shop at Indian grocery stores, you know our parent company Deep Foods Inc. as your trusted manufacturer and brand with over 800 SKUs. But our brand is still pretty new. In late 2019 we began a turnaround and rebrand of our Tandoor Chef® frozen brand and Indikitch® restaurants to Deep Indian Kitchen®. There was a need to fill with millennials and foodies actively seeking authentic ethnic experiences, but lacking high quality, modern Indian options. Our differentiated approach and products have made us an emerging brand with triple digit growth, due to the #1 fastest selling frozen Indian product in America, over 17K new points of distribution in 2021, over 110K followers on Instagram…we could go on.

  DonorsChoose engages the public in public schools by giving people a simple, accountable, and personal way to address educational inequity. In this clip, board member Stephen Colbert tells our story. 
   To date, teachers at 83% of all the public schools in America have posted classroom project requests on our site. Projects range from paper and markers for a poetry writing unit to violins for a school recital. More than 4 million ""citizen philanthropists"" have supported such projects, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 40 million students nationwide. In all, we've generated $1 billion for learning experiences designed by our country's most dedicated public school teachers. 
   GOOD Magazine highlighted us as one of 30 Places We Want to Work, while Fast Company named DonorsChoose one of the 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World—the first time a charity has made this list.

   You have experience working with customer support teams to address inquiries or frustrations that come through social media. 
   You strive for both perfection and efficiency, crave feedback, and love uncovering new ways to repurpose great work. 
   You're concise. 
   You have 1-2 years of experience in social media management, digital content creation, or a related field. 
   You are comfortable with social media listening tools such as SproutSocial, Hootesuite, or Later.

Company Overview:

TaskRabbit is a task management network that conveniently connects people with Taskers to handle everyday home to-do's, such as furniture assembly, handyman work, moving help, and much more. Acquired by IKEA Group - the world's largest furniture retailer - in 2017, TaskRabbit operates in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and is expanding its global reach rapidly.

As a pioneer of the sharing economy, TaskRabbit was founded in 2008 on the premise of neighbors helping neighbors. Since then, our network has grown to three countries, 45 cities and over 140,000+ Taskers, yet our core mission has remained the same. We want to make everyday life easier for everyday people. And by doing that, we can make your neighborhood a little more familiar.

In 2017, TaskRabbit launched TaskRabbit for Good (TR4G), which connects neighbors to build sustainable and compassionate communities. TaskRabbit for Good was created to make it easier for neighbors to give back locally and make a positive impact in communities around the world. TaskRabbit donates a portion of its service fee from all TR4G initiatives to best-in-class local non-profit organizations tackling social and environmental challenges.

TaskRabbit's headquarters is located in the heart of San Francisco, with two other offices in Austin, and London.

    Our Story 
    Trust is a fundamental part of humanity, but with the rise of the internet over the last couple of decades, our client has seen a plethora of trust issues emerge like spam, fraudulent transactions, hate speech, and online abuse. Today, with AI, computers take on more tasks usually done by humans, with an increase in efficiency and productivity. However, they understand the implications of AI, and the potential danger of not having visibility into how it affects the real world. There is a lack of trust in AI outcomes because often AI models can be opaque. Our client started their company because they believe there is a need for a new kind of Explainable AI Platform. One that enables organizations to get ahead of these issues by building trustworthy, transparent, and understandable AI solutions. 
    Their Story 
    Our client's team is motivated by helping the world to unlock the AI blackbox. They help humans harness AI to create more understanding around results, create actionable insights, eliminate biases, and identify performance gaps. They know that AI is the future and believe that learning the “why” behind the results is crucial to any business or platform. Our client is still an early-stage startup, and are rapidly growing their team! This is an exciting time to join an XAI startup that is quickly becoming a leader in the space. Our client is recognized as a pioneer in the field of Explainable AI, and has received numerous accolades, including: 100 most promising Technology Pioneers of 2020 by the World Economic Forum, Forbes 50 most promising AI startups, and a Cool Vendor in Gartner’s 2019 Cool Vendors in Enterprise AI Governance and Ethical Response report.

  In early 2015, Roy Steves and Shilo Jones knew that there was an opening in the market for a new kind of digital marketing agency. They designed the business around a few core concepts:
   We love to talk shop. One of the most rewarding aspects of their past careers had been meeting up with other eCommerce professionals, and comparing notes on what worked, what didn't, and what was learned. StatBid was to be a vessel for that sharing.
    We want to help, even outside our channel. An extension of the first, this allows us to use our own eCommerce experience to provide guidance and recommendations to those clients who could benefit from it-and not just within Google Ads. Roy and Shilo's passion extended to everything from attribution to margin management to inventory planning.
    We want to work with the best, from anywhere. In another diversion from our past experience, we decided to build StatBid as an entirely remote team. While we'd have to relearn how to manage and develop teams, as our in-office experience wouldn't port directly, we would have access to talent from across the country, and even the world.
   At Statbid, we’re a small group, with around ten full-time staff (including the founders), and a small host of incredibly talented freelancers from around the globe. The team at StatBid is learning quickly, improving daily, and helping produce sustainable profit and growth for our clients.
   While our team is remote, this position is currently limited to those working in the U.S.
   The Sr. SEO Content Manager has experience overseeing and executing on a website’s overall SEO strategy. This includes all facets of SEO from keyword research and on page optimizations, to technical SEO, content strategy and link building. They review organic search performance, identify problem areas and opportunities and provide actionable recommendations for improvement. They also have a support team dedicated to assisting with specific SEO specialties. The SEO Manager is often the first point of contact and the “face” of StatBid for our clients, and is responsible for the clear communication of expectations and results.
   The Sr. SEO & Content Manager develops and oversees the organic search strategies for clients related to technical SEO, on page SEO, link acquisition and content creation. They will have, or develop, deep familiarity with those contexts.
   Benefits & Compensation
   Our benefits start from day one, with no probationary period. We want you have a flexible, comfortable, and satisfying work life balance, and have built the company around that ideal.
   Starting Salary: $85,000 DOE
    THREE weeks of vacation per year.
    A mental health day off every month.
     In addition to your vacation time.
      You could use this as a three day weekend every month!
      Avoid crowds by doing fun stuff on a weekday!
    
    5 Paid Holidays per year.
    Up to 20 Hours per year PTO for Volunteering.
     We'll pay you to help your favorite charity, for example!
    
    Up to 40 hours per year of safe and sick time.
     We want you and your family happy and healthy!
    
    Health, dental, and vision insurance.
    401k, with company match up to 4%.
   Can Do
   You are especially strong in both written and verbal communication (email, Slack, phone, video-conference, in-person).
    You are proficient in Google Analytics and Google Search Console.
    You have advanced experience using SEO research tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs.
    You have used Screaming Frog or other web crawling tools to analyze a website with at least 10,000 URLs.
    You have used Data Studio or similar reporting tools to create custom reports from Google Analytics, Search Console, or other 3rd party data source.
    You are familiar with and competent in executing data analysis using spreadsheet or database tools (Google Sheets, Excel, Data Studio, etc.).
    You have improved a site’s authority score through link acquisition methods that drove keyword ranking improvements.
    You will create SEO-optimized content designed to deliver results, whether that be traffic, links, revenue, or all three.
    You have experience executing a content audit-reviewing existing content and providing optimization recommendations.
  
   Will Do
   Improve your existing SEO skill set using our internal knowledge base.
    Stay up to date on current events in SEO such as changing algorithms, new tools, industry case studies and news.
    You are a team-oriented player and recognize your success, and the success of our clients, is the success of the whole team.
    You embrace following the StatBid playbook (we don't work like other agencies, after all), but also work collaboratively to improve those standards.
    You are diplomatic and can say ""no"" to certain client requests that we don't support while preserving the client relationship.
    You seek ways to inform and train others around you, including colleagues and clients.
  
   Sources of Satisfaction
   You’ll get to help continue the growth of our agency’s SEO and Content offerings in a collaborative environment where your voice and opinions will be amplified.
    Due to the distributed nature of StatBid you have nearly complete geographic flexibility and some flexibility when you do your work (you'll need to have sufficient overlapping availability with our clients and teammates).
    There are always new problems to solve, and a new tool or trick to learn.
    Even operating within the StatBid playbook, you'll have the autonomy to have a large impact on both our clients and StatBid itself.
    There is also an expectation, with time allocated, for you to improve the StatBid playbook helping us continually improve.
    You'll get to work with established companies with talented teams that need a hand in driving their organic search strategy and execution.
    You have great work-life balance, with somewhat flexible hours, vacation time, sick leave, and mental health days off, and a team that will support you and provide adequate coverage when needed.
  
   Sources of Dissatisfaction
   You’ll have frequent demands upon your communication skills to communicate with clients and ensure recommendations are implemented in a timely manner.
    The double-edge sword that is the remote nature of StatBid can create some feelings of isolation with plenty of distractions, which requires someone that is predisposed to be disciplined and self-motivated to succeed.
    The tools and techniques we use change continuously, so our operational routines are never quite the same month over month, and adapting can be stressful when those changes are especially large or frequent.
    With continual problems to solve, there are always competing priorities and occasional emergencies to triage. Task switching can be taxing, if necessary.
    Some tasks are relatively repetitive, even monotonous. We try to automate these whenever possible, but where that's not practical or possible, they do need to get done.
   We believe that a company’s culture is an emergent property of its people, not something that can be decided and approved upon by a board, and then dictated to employees. As such, this isn't the first version of the list, and may not be the last.
   ""The Seven Cs""
   Conscientious: Everyone is trying to make their businesses successful, and each has their own journey toward that goal. We must therefore maintain an empathetic foundation in our interactions, with our peers, partners, clients, industry, and world. We operate with respect and care, especially over disagreement, but also in the way we individually, or collectively as StatBid, deal with others.
    Candid: We strive to be as transparent and honest as possible. Life’s opportunities increase proportionally to our willingness to have awkward conversations. While it’s easy to share victories, only through honest, candid assessment can we improve over time, and help others to do the same.
    Collaborative: There’s a saying: “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” While it’s surprisingly difficult to trace to an original source, it sticks in the public consciousness for good reason-some things will call for the first approach, others the second. StatBid is in the business of going far, and that takes a team. Humans are such a successful species, in part, due to our ability to combine our talents and experience, and we embrace this opportunity.
    Creative: Our industry changes far too quickly to allow any complacency. As a result, we must constantly be looking for new, innovative, and creative ways to approach challenges. Creativity demands the ability to step back, and find new perspectives on old limitations. We will rise to the challenge.
    Clever: Not only should we try to be creative in our problem solving, but our solutions themselves should display elegance. We are energized by scrappy, innovative thinking, and our business will be guided in no small part by that approach. This will allow us to punch above our weight class, and out-maneuver potential risks and barriers.
    Constructive: Everything we’ve built in the past can be improved upon. We are attached to our output, not our tools, and so we are always open to iterating on tools and processes, if it would improve the results. We will also provide candid suggestions to others who ask, and graciously consider suggestions that we receive. This philosophy allows us to build better things in the future.
    Non-Conformist: The seventh of our Cs only barely starting with a ""c"" provides for the fact that creative solutions sometimes require abandoning preconceptions and past standards. Our industry changes quickly, and despite this, there are all kinds of baggage that accumulate along the way. To mitigate this, we will always be open to considering wildly alternative solutions. To paraphrase Tim Ferriss: “Most people walk down the street on their legs. Does that mean we walk down the street with our hands? ...Not usually, no.” But we also reject the idea that there is a single solution that works for every business, or at every stage of that business’s life, and it’s up to us to spot the difference.

About Belle
Belle is a hyper-growth engagement company that is revolutionizing home care - and it all begins with the feet. With 25M+ U.S. seniors no longer able to reach or see their feet, a lack of self care quietly brings millions to immobility and drives $38B+ in preventable medical spend every year.

Through a proprietary clinical-spa foot care service covered by Medicare Advantage, Belle’s Advanced Nail Technicians or “Belle Technicians” play a critical role in the lives of those we serve. The Belle care model has been designed to:

Protect mobility and prevent 75%+ of widespread, costly foot complications;
Develop deep, trusted relationships with members;
Digitally connect the care team into the home through our regular monthly visits;
Identify and resolve whole health issues early (physical, mental and social)
Far more than foot care, our mission is to unite people and their care through joy.

Empathetic: sensitive to challenges faced by customers, customer service and the entire team in order to identify opportunities for improved efficiency or automation

Superb English fluency: clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we will say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings or work in-person

Based on current guidance, individuals are considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19 two weeks after receiving the final dose of any COVID-19 vaccine authorized or approved for use in the United States by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Eligibility for a booster against COVID-19 varies and is explained on the University’s web site located at https://coronavirus.rutgers.edu/covid-19-vaccine. Failure to provide proof of primary vaccination and booster will result in rescission of a prospective employee’s offer of employment and/or disciplinary action up to and including termination.

 Working hours
 You can expect to work around 40 hours per week. The role may involve shift work and unsocial hours to make sure there's cover throughout the production process.

 Ambassador Labs (formerly Datawire), the cloud native developer experience leader, enables developers to code, ship, and run applications faster and easier than ever. Maker of top Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) open source projects, including Emissary-ingress and Telepresence, Ambassador Labs delivers a developer control plane for Kubernetes that integrates the development, deployment, and production infrastructure for developers and organizations worldwide including Microsoft, PTC, NVidia, and Ticketmaster. Ambassador Labs is backed by top investors including Insight Partners, Matrix Partners, Trinity Ventures, and Four Rivers Group.
 We are looking to hire engineers that care as much about empowering developers as we do and have embraced the cloud native phenomenon that is taking over the world. We strongly believe that Ambassador Labs’ success is dependent on hiring a diverse team. Diversity means a broader spectrum of opinions, ways of working and approaches to solving problems; we feel it is critical to helping drive the creativity, innovation and sound decision-making our customers love us for!
 About the JobAs an engineer at Ambassador Labs, you will be working on products aimed at drastically improving the way cloud native developers work. Your impact will be felt by thousands of users at companies like Epic Games, Microsoft, PTC, Ticketmaster, Cisco and Unity Technologies. This is a rare opportunity to join a growing team of smart and empathetic software engineers. The role is focused primarily on development of new products and services.
 We have loosely adopted Basecamp’s Shape-Up approach to development by undertaking well-shaped projects in six-week cycles. As a team, our focus is firmly on products that help users make the shift to the cloud with Kubernetes, front and center.
 Here’s a bit more insight into what your work life will be like as an engineer on the Ambassador Cloud team at Ambassador Labs:
 Our products comprise multiple services and those services are written in various languages (the best language for that particular task), but as a member of the Ambassador Cloud team you’ll work primarily in Golang and Web-components (Javascript, CSS, React).
  You’ll work on Linux or Mac: some of us work on one platform, some on the other, each choosing whichever platform makes us the most productive.
  You’ll also use your favorite IDE or editor; although we use different ones, we’re oddly free of those silly “mine is the best” discussions : ).
  You’ll work on our SaaS product as part of a distributed team building a feature, or adding integrations with other tools, or improving performance and scalability, etc., in six-week development cycles, and then you’ll cool down between cycles doing self-directed learning, improving your tools, or maybe even hacking up a demo of an exciting new idea of yours.
  You and your team will use GitHub issues and Notion to plan and track the work, Figma for UI design, Markdown for documentation, CircleCI for continuous integration, Docker Hub for the resulting images, and of course Slack and Zoom. You’ll have a weekly all-company (Zoom) meeting to stay current on all the things, but we try hard to minimize the number of scheduled meetings in order to maximize focus time.
 Note that on-call responsibility is shared among all engineers in the organization, currently one week every three months.
 About You
 You are an engineer who enjoys developing products and you consider yourself a full-stack aficionado. At the core, you are motivated by figuring out ways for developers (your people!) to own their work through the power of microservices and Kubernetes. You’re driven by understanding customers and their problems. You move with purposeful action and, most importantly, you pride yourself on execution.
 We’re looking for candidates with a strong track record of putting Golang and Javascript to use to bring products to life. Ideally, you’ve already had some direct or indirect exposure to Kubernetes and have a passion for creating WOW experiences while at the same time making continuous improvements. Have a great idea? Act on it! You don’t have to go through layers of bureaucracy to get things done at Ambassador Labs (first of all because that’s against our philosophy, and secondly because we don’t have layers of bureaucracy!).
 Ambassador Labs is a remote-friendly company with “pods” in Boston, Portland and Montreal. Our pods are a way of bridging the gap between being 100% remote and working in an office. Eventually, when it is safe to do so, we will have physical offices in each of these locations for team members to go to on a part-time basis to fuel their creativity through brainstorming and watercooler conversations. This is our way of creating the best of both worlds. For now, everyone is 100% remote.
 How to Apply
 We are looking forward to hearing from you. We move quickly and decisively. We don’t need to talk to 20 other candidates to make a decision, so if the fit feels right on both sides, you can be part of the team as soon as next week! The first step is speaking to our People Person, followed by the engineering leadership, and then a few of your future colleagues/team members. Interviews are typically 30 - 45 minutes, all remote. We’ll talk through your background, your approach to work, and dive into your technical knowledge. No algorithms, no off-the-cuff coding sessions, or brainteasers: we want to hear about your real-life experience and successes, especially the users that you’ve made happy.
 This is a demanding application process and a significant career move that’s well worth considering. We appreciate you giving us that consideration, and we promise to give you our full attention in return. Talk to you soon!

The Implementation Consultant I serves as the customer's relationship manager & point of contact from the time that the account has been booked, through the onboarding phase of the customer journey. The Onboarding Consultant role is responsible for managing a book of business (80+ restaurants) within their assigned Region. They are expected to work autonomously under an Onboarding manager to complete expected goals for numbers of projects taken live per month, self managing and prioritizing what they work on based on customer need and Toast requirements.

The Implementation Consultant I must be comfortable with ambiguity and work flexibly in a business with aggressive growth goals. Leveraging their Toast product knowledge and project management skills, the Onboarding Consultant will partner with restaurant owners in order to build out a onboarding plan that will produce a high quality implementation experience within timeline and budget constraints.

About this roll* (Responsibilities)
Customer Relationship Manager (30%): The Onboarding Consultant is the primary point of contact for all clients post booking by sales. The Onboarding Consultant is chartered with managing the relationship with the client while creating & executing a detailed onboarding plan.

Onboarding & Training (30%): The Onboarding Consultant is responsible for setting up client databases utilizing information from the previous payroll provider or data provided by the client. The Onboarding Consultant will configure the Payroll system to the customers' unique setup needs in order to maximize the benefits of their toast purchase, such as decreasing payroll processing time, streamlining POS hours, and increasing efficiency.

Project Management (30%): Leveraging their strong project management skills, the Onboarding Consultant will manage several onboarding engagements simultaneously. Effective time management is an essential skill for all Onboarding Consultants as they are responsible for a large book of onboarding business and the restaurant industry is significantly time constrained.

Post Live Relationship Management (10%): As the client is transitioned over into the post-onboarding phase of the customer journey, the Onboarding Consultant is expected to ensure this transition goes smoothly and therefore is available to assist and guide the customer during their first several days of usage by providing guidance through questions or troubleshooting problems. This could take place in the form of email correspondence, sending additional educational resources, or holding follow-up training.

  Do you want to solve wide ranging analytical and business problems in a fascinating growth market with real societal impact? Then this is the role for you! The Consulting Services team at RMS has a proven track record in helping organizations to measure, manage and transfer their catastrophe risk. Our clients range from insurers and reinsurers to investment portfolio managers, financial institutions, governments, and corporates.
   We work closely with clients to deliver a wide range of analytical, advisory and technology services and solutions, including:
   Assessment of business best practices for risk management, implementation and optimization of workflows relating to RMS products
    Consulting around new emerging systemic risks facing society, including climate change, novel infectious disease, and pandemic
    Risk transfer consulting and optimization, including ILS and catastrophe bonds

   Consulting Services operates at the forefront of defining best practices for the quantification and management of risk. Joining this team offers an opportunity to drive the growth of a unique and fascinating market and help build resilience to the challenges society faces today.
   Objective of the role:
   A Senior Consultant is the face of our projects and owns the success – ultimately ensuring that the client’s objectives have been achieved through the delivery of the solution / advisory work. While this person is responsible for directing all the functional work of the project, the role requires visibility into all areas of the project (technical, quality assurance, and project management). This visibility ensures that the proposed or implemented solution meets the client’s needs (whether it is a model analytic, advisory, or implementation project).
   For smaller projects, a Senior Consultant will work side-by-side with a junior consultant or analyst to help create project artifacts and deliverables. For larger / complex projects that may have multiple workstreams, the Senior Consultant will direct the activities of junior consultants and analysts who perform the detailed work. Regardless, this person must be aware of all project details and is accountable for the quality of all functional artifacts and deliverables. Across all project types, a Senior Consultant works directly with clients at all levels. 
  In addition to project work, a Senior Consultant uses his/her network alongside marketing and sales activities to identify and drive consulting opportunities to signed contracts. This person also uses market knowledge and expertise on catastrophe analytics to develop and drive go to market of new service offerings. 
  Key Accountabilities & Deliverables
   A Senior Consultant is responsible for delivering solutions for complex projects with some oversight from senior leaders in the Consulting Services team. This person uses knowledge of industry best practices and RMS software, data, models, and services, to deliver high quality recommendations and solutions that either address existing client challenges or help clients create more value. Previous business transformation project examples include:
     Helping a major reinsurance broker determine the right approach to implement capabilities built on RMS latest cloud-based risk management analytics platform, Risk Intelligence
      Designing, building, and rolling out bespoke tools and applications for RMS’ clients around the world
      Helping a US insurer build internal capabilities around risk modeling for the first time
    
    In addition to delivering business transformation projects, a Senior Consultant can deliver complex model analytic projects using RMS models and software to help clients address unique challenges or opportunities. Previous project examples include:
    Partnering with customers to respond to the latest Bank of England climate change stress tests
    Consulting with a major U.S. bank to understand the earthquake-driven default risk prevalent in mortgage-backed securities, 
   Working with re/insurers to quantify their exposure to cyber risk for the first time
    Collaborate with sales colleagues to develop Consulting Services pipeline and win projects.
    Responsible for scoping and estimating project scope to inform resource estimates and commercial proposals to clients. Drive the development of project work orders, working closely with sales, technical, and project management colleagues. 
   Lead client meetings, including interviews and workshops, and meetings with executive sponsors and steering committees, as needed to deliver an engagement. In interactions with client stakeholders, a Senior Consultant advises executives on solution options, with analysis of the pros/cons and return on investment of the solution recommendation. 
   Manage project team members to deliver all functional project components.
    Manage projects and opportunities simultaneously.
    Influence key client stakeholders when providing business transformation recommendations. A key aspect of this is applying knowledge of the client’s business model to quantify the economic value of your recommendations with an ROI analysis.
    Contributes to the development of standard, repeatable processes and artefacts for implementation and assessment projects that drive process efficiency within Consulting Services.
    Help upskill and coach junior team members in domain and professional development topics. 
   Bring the voice of the client back to other teams within RMS and help influence our internal development decisions.
    Partner with RMS marketing team to participate in and lead industry events. This includes presenting at RMS’ annual client conference and leading webinars. In these presentations a Senior Consultant demonstrates industry thought leadership and applies RMS solutions to market trends and best practices.

   Be a pioneer in modern communication using technologies
  
  
  
    We're looking for an experienced Product Manager, Mobile to work with our team of Designers, Mobile Developers, and QA Engineers in helping us to build the best mobile experience for our deaf and hard-of-hearing users.
   
  
  
   Our mobile app is currently used by thousands of users every day, and we’re looking for someone to help us focus on what needs to be done to become the #1 captioning app in the world.
  
  
  
    Ava started as a mobile and cloud-based deep-learning system that ables to uniquely daisy chain mobile devices' microphones to accurately live-transcribe any conversation. As users brought it in massé at work and school, the platform quickly added human curation through live professional transcribers, multiple languages, and web & desktop compatibility.
  
  
  
    ""The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist."" — Zig Ziglar
  
   You'd be perfect for this role if:
   You’ve been a PM for a mobile app from scratch to high usage, at a tech startup
    You take pride in following strongly agile development, with well-detailed specs, burndown charts, and bi-weekly release cadences
    You aren’t afraid to analyze numbers, bug reports, and user feedback to prioritize the key needle movers and give insightful product directions to a team
    ✨ Nice to have: Experience with a messaging/communication or AI app (Messenger, Whatsapp, etc.)
    ✨ Nice to have: Seed to Series C startup experience
    ✨ Nice to have: Based in California (close to our Product Hub in LA or Tech Hub in SF)
   So... what will you do as a Product Manager at Ava?
   Organize and moderate product lifecycle meetings, including the backlog grooming, stand-ups, sprint planning & retrospective.
    Write business/functional requirements and turn them into product specifications & user stories.
    Co-design improved user experiences to implement in our mobile apps (iOS & Android).
    You will report to the Head of Product on the team's progress on the roadmap achievement & track the key results
   Why this role?
   Actually change lives at an unprecedented scale: How often do you hear about apps that make people cry with joy? It is really for us a unique opportunity and privilege to be able to meaningfully improve the lives of 100,000s people - and yet to still be at the very beginning of our mission!
    Join us at an incredible time: We're well-funded and hit product-market fit, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow, so we can create a more inclusive world.
    Work with some of the best people in the world: We have an incredibly talented and passionate team that is a lot of fun to work with. We're still super small and have accomplished some things that were thought impossible!
    Tackle our most interesting and impactful problems: Our team is still small, and people wear many hats. You'd jump between product, marketing, internal tools, process — participating in every phase from inception to implementation. Absolutely no boredom.
   Benefits
   Working 100% remote or hybrid based on preferences
   Great health, dental, and vision insurance.
    New laptop/equipment of your choice.
    Flexible vacation time & work hours.
    ‍ Work from the Paris office possible (1-2 weeks/year)
    ✈️ Team retreats once a year — to meet everyone in the world! Past trips have been to Tahoe, NYC, and Bali.
  
  
    Thanks for making it here. You probably are really good at what you do and have many choices in front of you. If you are looking to grow your unique talents and leverage them for something truly meaningful, while being in a great company, you've come to the right place.
  
  
  
    We hope you'll apply!
