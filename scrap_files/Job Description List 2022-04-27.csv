 Fortitude Re is a liability-led reinsurer of legacy insurance portfolios complemented by sophisticated investment capabilities. In 2016, AIG created a “Legacy” portfolio as a separate non-core segment representing insurance reserves associated with discontinued lines of commercial Property & Casualty and Life & Annuity insurance businesses. The following year, AIG formed a Bermuda-domiciled composite reinsurer, now Fortitude Re, to house the Legacy portfolio in a separate, distinct, well-capitalized balance sheet with a dedicated management team. In 2018, the company entered into a series of L&A and P&C reinsurance transactions with AIG and received an initial capitalization of ~$3 BN. The transactions represented ~$37 BN of reserves supported by ~$40 BN of invested assets. During this time, AIG also entered into a long-term partnership with The Carlyle Group, with Carlyle acquiring 19.9 % ownership. Then in 2019, The Carlyle Group and T&D announced acquisition of majority interest in Fortitude Re from AIG. This allowed for a new long-term shareholder base for the company while maintaining a strong capital position for supporting reinsurance obligations.

     Applicants must meet all the qualification requirements described below by the closing date of this announcement. If you are qualifying based on education OR if there are mandatory education requirements listed below, you MUST submit a copy of your college transcript with your application. 
      Applicants applying for the GS-05 must meet one of the qualification requirements listed below: 
      General Experience: 
     A. Completion of three years of general experience, one of which was equivalent to the GS-04 level, involving the analysis, explanation, application, or interpretation of laws, rules, regulations, procedures, etc. Qualifying general experience may have been gained as a law clerk, contact representative, claims examiner, voucher examiner, or similar work with a government or private employer.

     OR 
     C. Combination of education and experience. If you do not qualify based on education or experience alone, you can combine your education and experience by converting each to a percentage and then adding the percentages. To calculate this, determine your total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required; then determine your education as a percentage of the education required; then add the two percentages. The total percentages must equal at least 100 percent to qualify. 
     If you are qualifying based on education, you must submit a copy of your college transcript with your application, and if selected, an official college transcript will be required to verify education prior to employment. 
      Applicants applying for the GS-07 must meet one of the qualification requirements listed below:

     OR 
     B. Completion of 1 full year of graduate level education in law, or other administrative or management fields related to the position. For your information, one academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that your graduate school has determined to represent one academic year of full-time study. Such study may have been performed on a full-time or part-time basis. If you cannot obtain your graduate school's definition of one year of graduate study, 18 semester hours (or 27 quarter hours) should be considered as satisfying the requirement for one year of full-time graduate study. 
     OR 
     C. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university AND you meet one of the following provisions of the superior academic achievement:

      Membership in a national honor society (other than freshman honor societies) recognized by the Association of College Honor Societies.
       
     Grade point averages should be rounded to one decimal point. For example, 2.95 is rounded to 3.0, and 2.94 is rounded to 2.9. NOTE: If more than 10 percent of your undergraduate course work (credit hours) was taken on a pass/fail or similar basis, your claim must be based on class standing or membership in an honor society. OR D. Combination of graduate level education and specialized experience.

       Office/Unit/Project Description The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) serves as the integrator in the UN Development System, to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNDP has a Global Policy Network (GPN), a network of field-based and global technical expertise supporting delivery ofthe signature solutions in UNDP’s Strategic Plan.
       Within the GPN, the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) develops all relevant policy and guidance to deliver on UNDP’s Strategic Plan, providing technical advice to Country Offices, representing UNDP at multi-stakeholder fora and engaging in UN inter-agency coordination.
       Climate change is the single greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, UNDP’s “Climate Promise” supports over 120 countries to enhance climate ambition under the Paris Agreement, with focus on deeper emission reductions and resilience building.
       The second phase of the Climate Promise, launched in 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow, focuses on NDC implementation, climate advocacy, and long-term planning to ensure inclusive climate action required to keep global temperature below 1.5°C. UNDP is well positioned to enable such work through cooperation on HQ, Regional and Country Offices levels, an interconnected system of knowledge exchange and expertise enabling cutting-edge climate policy advocacy, development, and implementation.
       Countries are increasingly recognizing LULUCF as part of the mitigation efforts in their new or updated NDCs. According to the latest NDC Synthesis report, 84% of all parties are featuring LULUCF sector as part of their mitigation efforts. Stabilization of global temperatures cannot be achieved without reducing emissions from the forest sector.
       UNDP is well placed to support countries in meeting their LULUCF related targets set out in their NDCs, contributing to UNDP's 'signature solution' on environment and nature-based solutions for development.
       The Climate & Forest Programme is a global team, with management based in Geneva, global advisors in New York, and regional teams located in UNDP’s Regional Centres in Bangkok, Panama, and Nairobi, whichsupport the UNDP country offices and partners in their regions.
       The Climate and Forests Programme requires the services of a Technical Advisor to provide support in the implementation of a new area of work under the Forests, Land and Nature work area of UNDP’s Climate Promise, to increase ambition, implementation, of and engagement on NDCs. The Technical Advisor will contribute to the strategic integration of UNDP’s climate and forests work with support on NDC implementation, including tracking of NDC progress. This integrated support will involve close collaboration with the Climate Strategies and Policy team, Regional Technical Advisors and Country Offices in priority countries, and the work of the Forest Declaration (formerly called New York Declaration of Forests).
      
       Institutional Arrangement The IPSA professional will primarily report to the Global Technical Advisor, MRV & UNFCCC, with co-supervision by the Technical Specialist. This assignment is home-based with possible mission travels, if proven indispensable and subject to Covid-19 health regulations permit.

 We're an event management and marketing agency located in the Denver metro area. We serve about 15-20 high-tech, Silicon Valley clients at any given time. Our growth was interrupted by COVID, but business is starting to rapidly pick up again. One of our offerings is Marketo and Salesforce.com administration, and several of our clients are now asking for our help with their marketing operations needs. We are also bringing on new clients all the time, so we will likely see even more demand for this service offering.
 We're seeking a Marketo administrator who has at least 5 years of experience working with B2B companies and has a wide range of capabilities. Our clients are event marketers who require all sorts of Marketo and Salesforce.com work in support of their live and virtual events. Most of the work will be focused on routine marketing automation tasks such as email sends and lead imports.
 Primary Duties:
 -- Working with our graphic designer and developer to produce modular emails and guided landing page templates-- Sending pre- and post-event promotional and follow-up emails to attendees and registrants-- Configuring programs for webinars, regional events, and large tradeshows-- Formatting leads lists and importing/processing CSV files-- Communicating and working efficiently and effectively with our clients to successfully deliver their projects on time
 We'd like to establish an ongoing relationship with the right person. We value high-quality work, responsiveness, reliability, and flexibility. Our Marketo and Salesforce.com business fluctuates, but it's becoming steadier. We anticipate that our client base will regularly require about 10-20 hours of design work per week over the next several months, but that will likely increase. The ideal candidate would be able to grow with us, but it's not a requirement.
 We're looking for someone who will represent himself/herself as a resource of our company - basically a white-label arrangement. We'd give you a company email address, present you as an employee/resource, and send work your way!
 Requirements:
 -- At least five years of experience with Marketo is absolutely required! Some must-know areas:
 Formatting and importing leads - attention to detail is a must!
  Creating and updating smart campaigns
  Producing and sending emails
  Working with forms and templates
  Working with images in Design Studio
  Working with tokens
  Working with UTM codes
 -- Marketo certification is a plus, but not necessary-- Salesforce.com experience is a plus, but not necessary-- Very basic HTML editing skills (copying and replacing, for the most part)-- Good writing, editing, and proofreading skills-- Excellent communication skills - outgoing, and able to communicate effectively with clients on Zoom meetings and phone calls-- At least five years of experience working with marketing departments in B2B tech companies-- Able to excel in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment-- Self-starter who can work independently, with little supervision-- Flexible and responsive - able to respond to emergency requests in a timely manner (within reason)-- Computer skills and a good command of Microsoft Office

Join us for the opportunity to create groundbreaking games with some of the best developer talents in the industry. 
  Description: 
  We are looking for a Technical & Systems Game Designer to join a lean incubation team developing a brand new IP. 
  Why Join Us: 
  Pioneer new ways for players to ""adventure until the heat death of the universe."" 
   You're excited to work on a game that favors open-ended systems over tightly scripted moments, where players create their own stories through gameplay. 
   You value a gameplay-focused dev culture. 
   This is a founding member opportunity with major creative involvement from start to ship. 
   We actively work to create close trust and connection between teammates. 
   The phrase, ""High autonomy, high responsibility, with low oversight"", appeals to you. 
   You'll work on a lean team, where your contributions have a major impact to the project. 
   No crunch or overtime. We don't glorify this behavior! 
  Responsibilities: 
  As part of the Game Design team, invent, then implement gameplay systems and features consistent with project goals and tenets. 
   Validate your gameplay hypotheses through rapid prototyping and team feedback. 
   Ensure your work does not incur unplanned technical debt. 
   Communicate system designs to teammates in an audience-appropriate way. 
   Make your gameplay inventions genuinely flavorful to players, enriching the fiction of the world without compromising playable function and the long-term health of the game. 
   Lightweight self-production: basic task breakdowns, estimates, and timekeeping. 
   Model the culture and help build the team. Rotate through interview panels with all disciplines, onboard new hires, help tend to team health and culture in open team discussions. 
   Promote and build an inclusive work environment. 
   Work with developers in all disciplines and contribute to topics at the project level. While everyone has an area of focus, building a great game and a great development experience is everyone's responsibility. 
  Qualifications: 
  Fluency in one or more text-based scripting or programming languages such as C++, C#, or JavaScript, among others. 
   Very experienced with hands-on, iterative, rapid prototyping and direct implementation of gameplay features. 
   Experience building interrelated core gameplay systems. You are skilled at making unknown design spaces known, and can personally implement your systems such that they are easily extended by others in the future. 
   You've worked in domains where you've had to do some of the following: 
   Blend elements of strategic and real-time gameplay. Design very permissive and re-playable experiences that promote inventive player expression and cleverness. Invent and implement durable play patterns. 
   1 shipped commercial game OR a portfolio of personal projects which demonstrate your technical skills and the aforementioned design capabilities. (Please note: In the latter case, we require that your portfolio include at least one self-started solo project.) 
  If all this excites you, then we want to talk to you. Don't let doubt deter you! We are an equal opportunity team excited about our next journey. We are always looking for people bursting with creative energy to join us, so don't hesitate to apply. Please submit a resume and a link to your portfolio. We will get back to you once we have a chance to review!

     Column is looking to hire a full-time 
     Product Designer to join our Product team. The Product Designer will report directly to our CTO and should be jazzed about being the first design hire at a high-growth, early stage startup. As a Product Designer, you will be responsible for ideating, prototyping, and pushing pixel-perfect designs for engineers and collaborating with product managers to build designs that meet business needs.
     
    
  
  
   
    What You'll Do 
    First Week: You will learn about Column's mission and vision, seek to understand our product, design, and engineering processes, and begin meeting other folks on the team. We're a small company that's growing quickly, so interpersonal rapport is essential. 
     First Month: You will build out the initial structures of a design system. You will transform a product requirement document into a finalized design spec and collaborate with engineers to ship the final designs. 
     First Six Months: You will ship production-ready designs across all areas of our core product. You will own the entire design process from low-fidelity to high-fidelity design, ideating based on initial feature requirements, prototyping and interaction, and designing engineer-ready design specs. You will build structure, processes, and best practices from scratch. 
     First Year: You will build out a Column design system and design library that is scaleable as our company and design team grows. You will be an impactful founding member of a design team at a rapidly growing tech start-up that believes we have the potential to be a once in a generation company.

    You're looking for a remote-first role working with wildly talented people who care about their impact on local communities 
     You have experience with all stages of the design process — from ideation and user research to low- to high-fidelity mock-ups and delivering designs — and enjoy working with product managers and engineers on designs 
     You're excited to have exceptional ownership over the future of interface design at Column and embrace the fact that being the first designer on means that you will have little day-to-day guidance, support, or feedback from other designers 
     You're comfortable working on a team and in an environment that moves quickly while maintaining pixel-perfect design standards 
     You're familiar with web-first design practices, care about designing for accessibility, and have created and/or owned a design library 
     You have a strong desire to exemplify our operating principles — be worthy of trust, do the hard work, never stop learning, intentionally build community, and tell a better story 
     You have grit and really want to work with us — if you do not resemble our ideal candidate, tell us why you'd still be a great fit for this role in an optional cover letter 
    Compensation and Benefits Column is built on the belief that important information should be accessible to the public. As such, we work hard to model this behavior for potential Columnists by including our base compensation in all job descriptions and making our full benefits accessible online. 
    Base compensation of $102,000 - $120,000 commensurate with experience and level, plus stock options and 401k plan with 5% match 
     Healthcare, vision, & dental coverage for you and your dependents 
     Unlimited (and encouraged) paid time off and 16-weeks paid parental leave 
     Multiple stipends for you to invest in a home office setup and pursue wellness activities that make you feel healthy and whole

We address real problems that people face in their communities. We believe that we have the potential to be a generational company that will change the world as we know it. Will you join us?

 Pipeline Conditioning, LLC is a successful start-up headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado. We are a service provider to natural gas utility companies across the country.

Pipeline Conditioning, LLC has proprietary tools and equipment that allow for this process to occur with no disruption in service and for the pipelines to remain odorized, ensuring optimum safety downstream.
 At Pipeline Conditioning, LLC we take pride in being a safety-conscious and employee-centered company. We strive to be the employer of choice in the natural gas industry by offering our employees many benefits that larger companies simply cannot, and will not, compete with.

    At Instructure, we believe in the power of people to grow and succeed throughout their lives. Our goal is to amplify that power by creating intuitive products that simplify learning and personal development, facilitate meaningful relationships, and inspire people to go further in their educations and careers. We do this by giving smart, creative, passionate people opportunities to create awesome. And that's where you come in:
   
   
   
     The Instructure Technical Support group is responsible for providing technical assistance to the end-users of Canvas, our cutting-edge LMS software. Technical Support Representatives support end users, learning management systems administrators, and corporate users. Part Time agents are asked to support all of our users, through all channels (Phones, Emails and Chats). We do start our new hires out on our easier delegations to help them get used to the software and systems. 90 days after hire, we do require you to be in all channels. You’d also advise clients regarding the product's use and address specific user issues. During problem escalations, you’d act as a liaison between customers and Tier 2 Support. They will assist the clients from issue initiation through resolution or escalation.
   
   
   
     The Force never sleeps and neither do we! Our Support team is awesome and available 24/7. You should expect to be scheduled for a 20 hour week, but as volume increases you may be required to work a 30 hour week, with hours being added to the beginning and/or end of their shift. As volume decreases you could be asked to work less hours. Notice will be given to make adjustments. That typically falls between 6:00am - 10:30pm MST, 7 days a week (so yes, you do need to have availability to work weekends). We can’t guarantee any shifts that will be given upfront because we like to keep things spicy (and they’re based on tenure), which is why we ask for open availability in order for this valuable relationship to get off the ground.
   
   
  
   
    Here's what you'll be doing: 
    Take incoming phone calls from admins, teachers, and student end-users When taking phone calls: Validate and clarify the issue reported Answer how-to questions Fix end-user issues that are resolvable through the Canvas user interface Replicate, troubleshoot, and describe simple bugs Keep thorough, clear, and complete records in the ticketing system of all actions taken Escalate call tickets not resolvable at the L1 level to the L2 Support team Direct users to the correct helpdesk in instances where we cannot accommodate their request Be friendly, efficient, and dependable, and always provide timely updates to users Perform other duties as assigned by supervisor
    
   
  
   
    Here's what you'll need to know/have:
     High School diploma or equivalent. Working on and/or some kind of College experience in information technology fields, preferred. Familiarity with Canvas, preferred. Strong troubleshooting, and analytical skills. Proven ability to function in a self-directed environment. Fluent in English; Exceptional communication skills, both written and verbal. Customer service experience, preferred. Ability to excel in a fast-paced, agile environment where critical thinking and strong problem solving skills are required for success. Ability to think quickly, communicate positively (even when sharing bad news), work proactively, and readily embrace change Ability to handle clients professionally during all interactions. Sense of humor. Like a really funny one.
    
   
  
   
    Workspace Expectations: 
    The workspace must be private (e.g. not a library or coffee shop). The workspace must be physically secure, located behind a door that the remote agent can close and lock when leaving the space. The workspace must allow the remote agent to participate in phone calls without the other party detecting that they are working in a non-office setting. The workspace must have a fast, stable internet connection. The workspace must be adequately lit and climate-controlled.
    
   
  
   
    We’ve always believed in hiring the most awesome people and treating them right. We know that the more diverse we are, the more diverse our ideas will be and when we openly welcome those ideas, our environment is better and our business is stronger.
   
   
   
     At Instructure we participate in E-Verify and yes, in case you didn't catch it from the above, we are an Equal Opportunity Employer.
    
   
   
    All Instructure employees are required to successfully pass a background check upon being hired.

   The Information Security Consultant provides consulting and assurance services to business. There are two major aspects to this position:
   (1) Providing consulting services to business as businesses engage GSO to provide guidance with respect to new projects or development or technology deployments / enhancements.
   (2) Providing security assurance assessments services for existing or new environments.
  
   The position requires a strong ability to interface with technical and business experts and articulate the risk in business terms.

The responsibilities also include staying with the project through the cycle (from inception to product implementation) and validating the implementation of security controls, as needed.
    Partner with businesses and technology teams to research and provide security guidance for strategic projects involving new technologies or concepts (e.g. moving a core application to cloud, or developing mobile application, new authentication technology, encryption techniques or technologies, etc.). The position requires on-going partnership (vs. one-time guidance) to build environments and deploy technologies in a secure manner and mitigating risks beforehand – truly positioning security as a business enabler.
    Escalate risks to BU security champions and the Regional Information Security Officers (RISOs) as they appear.
    Assist with pre- and post-acquisition security assessments.
    Under the guidance of RISOs, work with businesses and technology teams to capture exception requests and information and ensure non-compliance issues, exception justification, mitigation controls and risks are appropriately captured. Escalate issues as needed.
    Provide reporting metrics for InfoSec consulting function and progress on enhancement initiatives.
    Process requests (for security assessments, various types of approval requests and other items) per the established SLAs.
    Partner and work with other GSO teams to ensure GSO programs are deployed successfully, where applicable.

The role
In the role you will join a condensed 2-month training program before entering the full workforce as a fully-fledged Cyber Security Consultant working within our information assurance and penetration testing team.
A Unique Experience… You will be part of a team starting a journey within one of the most intensely exciting, technically driven, growing industries around! Nettitude’s Launch Program offers incredible opportunities to immerse yourself in a range of deep dive technical cyber subjects that all focus on giving you the best possible introduction into Penetration Testing. You will learn not only how to hack traditional infrastructure and web applications but we will expose you to the rigors of reverse engineering, cryptography and threat intelligence taught by our seasoned principal security consultants who hold the highest industry qualifications and accreditations.
An Innovative Approach… At Nettitude you will be immersed in an environment where you are trained in a robust curriculum through a series of foundation, core and advanced topics, giving you the ability to start your career as a security consultant off on the right foot. Many junior consultants learn how to hack without the understanding of how this applies to the world of finance, defence or business in general.

Each week is different, and the approach, subjects, pace and style are deliberately changed to ensure you can adapt and progress to your best potential. These are all backed up with practical workshops, hands-on real-world experience, shadowing and project work. Towards the end you will also be given the opportunity to lead engagements with real clients under the supervision and guidance of senior consultants.
Key skills:
Our Launch Program is designed with the following in mind:
It’s for junior penetration testers, career changers or anyone else who has some experience with the offensive side of the cyber security industry but would like some additional training before performing their own engagements.

 We are a software, data and research company primarily working in the cannabis and CBD industry since 2016. We are quickly expanding into numerous other industries. Our mission is to help individuals make more informed purchasing, consumption and treatment decisions with data, not reviews. 
  We collect a wide range of real world evidence data on the use, performance, effectiveness, and safety of specific products reported anonymously by individuals. Some of the datasets are structured in the form of consumer studies where a specific use, symptom, or condition is being studied. Other datasets are less structured and more “messy” because it’s real world data coming from individuals tracking their product use and experience in the form of a mobile journal. 
  Regardless of the format, you would be provided with a raw dataset and specific goals or objectives that we have as a business in learning from the data. The goals and objectives will range from specific items like hours of sleep before vs after a product is used, to general questions like what does the data tell us about the use and performance of this product and/or brand. 
  We need someone who can take these raw sub-datasets and create a report that summarizes facts and findings within the data that we can use to create blog articles, press releases, and other social/digital content.

You ask questions early in your tenure and often, and have no problems with saying ""I don't know.""
You want to know why you're building what you're building and the customer pain points we're all trying to solve.
You will mentor members of the development team (of more and less experience - we think it goes both ways) on software development best practices and new technologies with relevant cases for their use.
You want to create scalable processes that reduce or automate repetitive tasks through continuous improvement.
Your team's culture is important to you, and our culture resonates with you.
Culturally, we want members of our team to be confident enough to present an idea and build a case for it while maintaining a level of humility that there are multiple solutions and theirs may not be the one leveraged. Also, they should be willing to speak up and ask questions or for help and know that that is not only encouraged, but preferred. Transparency and communication are crucial."|2022-04-27

They must apply School and classroom rules consistently and effectively; make use of preventive discipline; and effectively supervise students both in their classroom and elsewhere on School grounds.

The Onboarding Consultant role is responsible for managing a book of business (80+ restaurants) within their assigned Region.

The Implementation Consultant I must be comfortable with ambiguity and work flexibly in a business with aggressive growth goals. Leveraging their Toast product knowledge and project management skills, the Onboarding Consultant will partner with restaurant owners in order to build out a onboarding plan that will produce a high quality implementation experience within timeline and budget constraints.

Project Management (30%): Leveraging their strong project management skills, the Onboarding Consultant will manage several onboarding engagements simultaneously. Effective time management is an essential skill for all Onboarding Consultants as they are responsible for a large book of onboarding business and the restaurant industry is significantly time constrained.

Post Live Relationship Management (10%): As the client is transitioned over into the post-onboarding phase of the customer journey, the Onboarding Consultant is expected to ensure this transition goes smoothly and therefore is available to assist and guide the customer during their first several days of usage by providing guidance through questions or troubleshooting problems. This could take place in the form of email correspondence, sending additional educational resources, or holding follow-up training.
