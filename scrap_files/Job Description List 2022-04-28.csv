To calculate this, determine your total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required; then determine your education as a percentage of the education required; then add the two percentages. The total percentages must equal at least 100 percent to qualify. 
     If you are qualifying based on education, you must submit a copy of your college transcript with your application, and if selected, an official college transcript will be required to verify education prior to employment. 
      Applicants applying for the GS-07 must meet one of the qualification requirements listed below: 
      A. Completion of at least 1 full year of specialized experience (equivalent to the GS-05 level in the Federal service) that demonstrated knowledge of the immigration and/or nationality laws of the United States. Qualifying specialized experience may have been gained in work such as developing, examining, investigating, or authorizing claims arising under the immigration and/or nationality laws of the United States. 
     OR 
     B. Completion of 1 full year of graduate level education in law, or other administrative or management fields related to the position. For your information, one academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that your graduate school has determined to represent one academic year of full-time study. Such study may have been performed on a full-time or part-time basis. If you cannot obtain your graduate school's definition of one year of graduate study, 18 semester hours (or 27 quarter hours) should be considered as satisfying the requirement for one year of full-time graduate study. 
     OR 
     C. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university AND you meet one of the following provisions of the superior academic achievement: 
      
      A grade-point average of ""B"" (3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale) for all completed undergraduate courses or those completed in the last two years of undergraduate study.
      A grade-point average of ""B+"" (3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale) for all courses in your major field of study, or those courses in your major completed in the last two years of your undergraduate study.
      Rank in the upper one-third of your class in the college, university, or major subdivision.
      Membership in a national honor society (other than freshman honor societies) recognized by the Association of College Honor Societies.
       
     Grade point averages should be rounded to one decimal point. For example, 2.95 is rounded to 3.0, and 2.94 is rounded to 2.9. NOTE: If more than 10 percent of your undergraduate course work (credit hours) was taken on a pass/fail or similar basis, your claim must be based on class standing or membership in an honor society. OR D. Combination of graduate level education and specialized experience. If you have some but not all of the experience or education described above, you may still qualify by combining the amount of creditable experience and education that you do have. To do so, convert each to a percentage and then add the percentages the sum of which must equal at least 100%. For example, an applicant who has 6 months of professional experience (50% of the experience requirement) and at least 9 semester hours of creditable graduate work (50% of the education required) would satisfy the qualifications requirements for the GS-07 level. 
     If you are qualifying based on education, you must submit a copy of your college transcript with your application, and if selected, an official college transcript will be required to verify education prior to employment.

 You can expect continued specialized training once onboard and opportunities to work on some of the Bureau's most complex cases. The scope and scale of our investigations provide unique challenges unlike anything you could work on in the private sector.

 Code Galaxy is a startup focused on making coding fun for kids ages 7-18. We believe that childhood should be a time of exploration and growth for students. Currently there is a lack of quality technology and coding education in schools.

 Code Galaxy provides structure and guidance in a fun yet challenging collaborative environment. Our students learn basic to advanced computer and programming skills, giving them 21st century tools for creative expression. The online program provides access and flexibility to launch kids ahead with the skills and habits of mind needed in the age of technology.

 We are looking for someone who has experience in AP CS Test preparation, enjoys teaching kids, has strong coding skills, and can assist us with designing our AP Computer Science Curriculum. All teaching will be done virtually. Therefore, a stable internet connection, a computer capable of running any necessary programs while screen sharing, availability in CST time zone, excellent communication skills and being able to engage with the students online are essential. The ideal candidate is organized and self-motivated, able to lead students in their learning in an efficient and high-quality way, bringing the best experience possible to parents and students.
 Your responsibility
 Assist in creating the AP Computer Science Test Prep curriculum and design additional sessions

  Why Join Us: 
  Pioneer new ways for players to ""adventure until the heat death of the universe.""

   You've worked in domains where you've had to do some of the following: 
   Blend elements of strategic and real-time gameplay. Design very permissive and re-playable experiences that promote inventive player expression and cleverness. Invent and implement durable play patterns. 
   1 shipped commercial game OR a portfolio of personal projects which demonstrate your technical skills and the aforementioned design capabilities. (Please note: In the latter case, we require that your portfolio include at least one self-started solo project.) 
  If all this excites you, then we want to talk to you. Don't let doubt deter you! We are an equal opportunity team excited about our next journey.

   The role: 
    Being a web designer at B12 is being a main contributor to the success of the company! At B12, our web designers use our design suite to put together initial websites for our customers after drafts have already been made by our AI. You'll work closely with our customer success team and our other design experts to focus on what you love most-design! If you enjoy freelancing, designing websites, and working in an open and creative environment, then the web designer role with B12 is the right fit for you! 
    As a web designer you will: 
   Read and interpret customer briefs. Our current customers are small and medium-sized businesses ranging from cafés to real estate investment firms. 
    Given a new customer's content and preferences, as well as a website that has been automatically generated for the customer, use our Design Suite (a largely WYSIWYG website editor with support for custom HTML5/CSS overrides) to put an initial website together for the customer in ~4 hours. 
    Complete enhancement requests for existing customer websites, ranging from small changes to more complex customizations or design improvements. 
    As a fast-growing platform, there will be adjacent opportunities as reviewers and mentors for the right candidates who wish to grow with us. 
   In our experience with past customers, designers spend single-digit numbers hours on each project, with iterative feedback from our team. You might intersperse multiple customers' project delivery while waiting on design feedback from the customer and our design lead. In addition to doing customer delivery work, you will be helping us co-design our Design Suite, as well as a workflow management tool called Orchestra. We have open sourced Orchestra, and are building it to empower creative and analytical experts in their work. 
   
  
   You'll be a good fit if: 
   You are remote or a local NYC web designer. 
    You have excellent written English skills. 
    You have 3-5 years of web design experience and are excited to do customer-focused website delivery. 
    You have 1-2 years of HTML/CSS experience. 
    You are available minimum 10 hours a week, maximum 20 hours a week. 
    You are comfortable turning unstructured customer content and requests into into pixel-perfect web designs that work on all devices. 
    You are excited to receive feedback from a customer success manager or an art director, and are equally excited to push back on design decisions you disagree with. 
    You have desktop and mobile web design experience. 
    You are happy to work on a customer deliverable for a few hours at a time, and then move on to a different customer's deliverable. 
    You are excited to learn our Design Suite. 
    You care about and want to contribute to our mission of helping people do meaningful work. 
   Don't fear: 
   We're flexible on the number of years of previous experience for this role. We highly favor talent and interest. 
    Some candidates may see this list and feel discouraged because they don't match all the items. Please apply anyway: there's a good chance you're more wonderful than you think you are. 
    B12 is a safe place for human beings. We particularly encourage you to apply if you identify as a woman, are a person of color or other underrepresented minority, or are a member of the LGBTQIA community. 
   
  
   Benefits: 
   Get paid for your expertise, we value the skills you bring as a designer. 
    Grow within our community - join other designers in our network (we actively use Slack) and get feedback to help you grow. 
    Shape the future of work - we highly value your input and working together we hope to design tools to change the way we work.

In this role, you will:
Learn or sharpen existing SQL and Python skills starting with our two month new hire training program that will teach you SQL, PySpark, and Python fundamentals as well as our internal tools and processes to get you ready to run your first product. You'll complete training with a group of other Data Specialists and will have additional support from your manager as well as our Product Operations team that runs the training program!
Be the primary owner running or building new data products end-to-end from data ingestion or web scraping through publishing reports and sending granular data feeds to clients. With the rapid growth of our portfolio of data products, you will very quickly have opportunities to build new products or improve existing ones.
Work with massive amounts of data and datasets to answer our clients' key questions about the companies we cover. You will learn about our proprietary methods and techniques to ensure data accuracy and derive key insights, and will become a trusted and reliable resource for our clients.
Learn how investors use data in their investment decisions by contributing to data reports that are consumed by the top investors in the world. You'll gain insight into how investors think about companies and the most important questions they need to answer to make stock portfolio recommendations .
Work on a small team of 5-10 within a 50+ person Data team.

The Data team is also supported by the Product Operations team, which is dedicated to ensuring everyone has the tools, training, and resources to work effectively and efficiently.
Build a career as a Manager or Individual Contributor through our career ladder that promotes based on impact. Strong performers have the opportunity to quickly start building their own team as a Manager or build new products and take on our highest impact products as an Individual Contributor. In the past, other Data team members have also moved to other departments within YipitData such as New Product Development, Research, or Product Operations, and some pursue roles outside the company at hedge funds or in senior data roles at other tech companies.

You have strong attention to detail
You are a methodical problem solver
You can clearly communicate complex concepts, both orally and written
You strive to make tasks as efficient as possible
You have an ability to manage multiple priorities
You have a strong ownership mentality and want to ensure our products are the best in the world

We care about your personal life and we mean it. We offer flexible work hours, unlimited vacation, a generous 401K match, parental leave, team events, a wellness and work-from-home budget, learning reimbursement, and more!
Your growth at YipitData is determined by the impact that you make, not by tenure, unnecessary facetime, or office politics. Everyone at YipitData is empowered to self-improve and master their skills in an environment focused on ownership, respect, and trust.
The annual base salary for this position is anticipated to be $70K ~ $95K.

Apprentices will then join a Google team to train on-the-job, while continuing to engage in track-specific learnings and career workshops throughout the program.

We focus on how to make these interactions better, easier, faster, as well as more delightful, interesting, and innovative. Each project is assigned an interdisciplinary pod from strategy, analytics, research, creative, technology, and production. Interaction Designers work closely with Experience Strategists, who focus on architecting the system of templates and modules, and Content Strategists, who handle the overarching site structure and taxonomy.

WHAT YOU'LL DO
Be an active participant in client work – you may join a project at the start, or one that is already in full swing. In either case, the ability to jump in and be okay with asking questions will be extremely important
Be a part of both internal and client work sessions – this allows everyone to sketch (and re-sketch) to work through ideas before sitting down to the computer
Work as the sole Interaction Designer on a project or paired with a senior IxD
Be a key member of multiple teams throughout full project lifecycles
Support and learn from other disciplines, for ex: brainstorm features with strategy, participate in user research, answer tech questions
Participate in the overall growth and development of the IxD team
Work to understand the client's business needs and goals, and how those intersect with the consumer's experience
ESSENTIALS
An openness to learning
An appreciation of soft skills, specifically, listening and communicating effectively – in writing, speaking, and presenting (in-person and on conference calls)
The ability to clearly articulate your decision-making and design process, challenge assumptions respectfully, and give and receive feedback
An exceptional attention to detail
SUMMARY

While you are expected to work collaboratively, IxDs have a set of core responsibilities:
Bring a high-level of creativity and creative problem solving to each project, and be comfortable with pushing boundaries
Create wires and detailed annotations that are informative and understandable for clients, designers and devs
Create prototypes to explain key interactions and flows to clients, designers and devs
Proficiency with tools such as Sketch, AirTable, Confluence, Jira, Principle, Invision, and Keynote, and the willingness to learn whatever the latest and greatest may be
Estimate work, commit, and deliver on deadlines. Be vocal if you don't think it's possible and ask questions if you're really not sure
ABOUT US:

Code and Theory is a strategically driven, digital-first creative agency that lives at the intersection of creativity and technology. We solve consumer and business problems across the entire customer journey that flex to meet the ever-changing needs of consumer expectations. We put the user, their behaviors and needs, at the center of everything we do — from our proprietary research methodologies, to product development processes, to how we create brand, channel and messaging strategies. Our goal is simple: to solve our clients business problems.

We bring big ideas to life by looking holistically at brand ecosystems where digital plays a prominent role in driving the consumer from first-touch through to conversion to relationship deepening over time. We identify gaps in the consumer journey and opportunities in culture that require products, services or communications to fill. We work across categories, ranging as far and wide as health care (Pfizer, Sanofi, Reach MD, Bioreference Laboratories) to financial services (JP Morgan Chase, Prudential, Morgan Stanley, First Data) to cpg (Mars, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson) to technology companies (Facebook, Xerox, Samsung, Comcast) to culture brands (adidas, H&M). And because our DNA is in publishing — we've embedded in over 135 newsrooms in the past decade — we bring unique expertise in understanding how content is created, distributed and optimized, including our work with CNN, NBC News, NBC Sports, and Bustle Digital Group.

At Code and Theory, we strive to only be limited by our own ambition and creativity. We believe in pushing our creativity beyond the easy and obvious answers in order to deliver the solutions that are right for our clients, their businesses, and their consumers.

According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.
Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.
The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

Applicants are urged to follow carefully all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira. For more detailed guidance, applicants may refer to the Manual for the Applicant, which can be accessed by clicking on “Manuals” hyper-link on the upper right side of the inspira account-holder homepage.

    Our Security team works to create and maintain the safest operating environment for Google's users and developers. Security Engineers work with network equipment and actively monitor our systems for attacks and intrusions. In this role, you will also work with software engineers to proactively identify and fix security flaws and vulnerabilities. 
    As Google's products handle information at a large scale, we need to anticipate and protect against attackers targeting Google and our users. 
   As an Information Security Engineer, you can perform realistic offensive security exercises to simulate real attacks, to test and improve our detection and response capabilities, and to identify how attackers could infiltrate and move inside our infrastructure. 
   With your technical expertise, you will create scenarios that advanced attackers might use to compromise our security. You will emulate both the techniques used by known groups, and create new techniques that attackers might attempt in the future. After each exercise, you'll thoroughly document findings and present the results to partners and leadership. 
   You will work closely with teams to improve our detection capabilities, and other parts of security team and affected product teams to design defense-in-depth controls that limit attackers' ability to move inside our network. 
   At Google, our users come first, and the Systems Infrastructure team is at the heart of that promise. We build the technologies that transform the way we think about doing business. Whether working on our cloud systems, researching the latest in computer technology or keeping Google's internal systems humming, Googlers and users alike rely on us to keep things running. We're back-end experts: protecting your privacy and ensuring your security.

We are guided by a deep belief that every person on Medicare should be treated like we would treat a member of our own family: with loving care and a profound commitment to their health and well-being.
   
   
   
     Why Devoted: 
   
   
    Make a difference... a big difference. You will have the opportunity, in a unique and dynamic culture, to be a part of something incredibly meaningful. We’re a disruptive startup with an inspiring mission. Learn and grow alongside our world-class team of healthcare, technology, and data leaders, dedicated to building a health plan and clinical services that care for everyone like they were our own mothers or fathers. Our team and board members have decades of experience in health care entrepreneurship, data, technology, services, and policy. With their support, we look forward to building a health plan and clinical services that will give seniors easy access to the high-quality care they deserve.
    
   
   
    A bit about this role:
   
   
   
     We are planning to deliver the best care for consumers in healthcare - and that’s going to require some new and better tools, and some new and better data analytics. Most healthcare teams don’t have the tools and data they want at their fingertips. Their systems are siloed, high latency, and transaction focused… all of which make it difficult to move healthcare to a world where we pay for value and care for members seamlessly.
   
   
     So while we are gearing up to deliver outstanding care, we are also building the tools that the whole industry needs to transition to better care instead of just more care. This will be the first platform of its kind in healthcare.
   
   
   
     We are looking for a seasoned product manager who knows consumer products and tools, understands which data to collect and pay attention to, and who is excited to take on complicated and challenging problems. Someone who seeks to make something that is complex feel simple and intuitive. Our goal is to build technology which lets human interactions shine through; which provides the context and data needed, and then gets out of the way.
    
   
   
    In this role you will create a vision for how the consumer experience can be transformed in healthcare, creating both customer satisfaction and better health outcomes through improved data and coordination.
   
   
     Your teammates will be world class, and you’ll get to learn from the absolute best across the industry.
   
   
  
   
    Responsibilities will include:
     Create the vision for the platform which will bring customer support and payer systems into the 21st century, delivering the tools for reps and our doctors to deliver and simple and magical experience to consumers. Work with engineering, data, research, UX, operations, and sales to deliver this vision. Define a set of KPIs to measure customer satisfaction and operational impact, and be able to analyze them and utilize them in decision making processes. Drive continuous improvement to these KPIs. Work with internal operations teams to transform their delivery model through the continuously evolving platform.
    
   
  
   
    Attributes to success:
     A super proactive ""get it done"" attitude, and the skills to back it up. The uncanny ability to get everyone on the same page in a complex cross-functional environment. Ability to manage a wide array of stakeholder groups, including the ability to listen and solicit carefully, and synthesize all their input into an action plan. Then communicate it back to them, and eventually, the whole company. Excellent communication skills, including ability to clearly articulate needs, objectives, priorities, and strategy in writing. Comfort with the uncertainty inherent in a startup. Deep desire to make U.S. healthcare better.
    
   
  
   
    Required skills and experience:
     Ability to work in a fast-paced, startup environment. 8+ years of software product management or product development experience. A proven track record of shipping products with business value. A history of translating customer insights into tools that customers love to use. Excellent communication skills — you will need to work with a highly cross-functional team. Experience in operations, operations strategy, and engineering. Knowledge of healthcare, or an enthusiasm to learn. Proven track record of shipping products with proven business value. A history of translating customer insight into recommendations that customers love to act on.

Who We Are and What We're About:

Brightline is on a mission to build a bright future for every child, bringing extraordinary behavioral health care to children and families.

We're in the middle of a behavioral health crisis that we can't ignore—especially not when it comes to our children. 1 in every 5 children has a behavioral health condition, yet up to 80% still get little or no help. Far too many families face insurmountable barriers when their child really needs help, and parents are too often left feeling alone and without the support they need. We can do so much better. That's why we're here!

When you join Brightline, you're joining a team that has an unstoppable drive to change the lives of families across the country. We're a team of thoughtful problem-solvers, expert and kind clinicians, and experienced operators and technologists. Above all, we're committed to helping each other succeed, learn, and grow—all while bringing care to families when, where, and how they need it.

No matter what you're looking for in your next role, we're pretty confident that you'll #FindItAtBrightline.

Our Tech Stack

We are primarily a Ruby on Rails shop and we are bought into keeping our tech stack simple so that we focus on shipping fast and having fun. Instead of betting on exciting new technologies, we favor straightforward solutions and defining standards so that the codebase and ecosystem are a joy to work with.

We use Tailwind and ViewComponent to make beautiful UIs. Stimulus brings them to life and if we feel the need for it, we might sprinkle some React on top. We use Typescript where we think it benefits us, and fall back to Javascript otherwise.

We run on Docker containers in Aptible. GitHub Actions powers our CI process. Thanks to feature toggles and an extensive test suite we feel comfortable deploying whenever we want.

Our data is backed by PostgreSQL and Redis. We collect and push data to our Data Science team via Ahoy, FluentD, and Stitch. Most of this ends up in Snowflake where we can generate awesome reports using Mode Analytics.

We make debugging and gathering insights for developers easy by collecting all sorts of traces in Datadog and Sentry.

We add what we need when we need it. We say goodbye to what is no longer useful.

As an early engineer at Brightline, here's what your day-to-day activities might look like:
Collaborate on projects end-to-end - from scoping features with product and design to shipping a finished feature into production
Write code across the entire stack (currently Ruby + Rails on the backend and TypeScript + React on the frontend, open to experience with Python + Django or similar languages and frameworks who are excited to work in Rails)
Have a mix of heads-down and pairing time, depending on the project and your energy levels
Curate a great codebase through architecture discussions, automated testing and code review
Bring a new perspective that helps our team continue to grow and improve
Care & Coaching Pillar:

We have 3 main workstreams on the pillar. Here are the kinds of projects you might work on in your first few months:
Member Care Experience:
Get members to the right type of live care that will improve their health

Build new care programs for our members with visuals so they can track progress
Implement data-driven clinical assessments

Innovate on new tools that allow us to provide better care
Improve the chat experience between our members and providers
Care Foundation:
Improve core services and APIs for the all engineering teams
Build tools for our internal member support team
Create efficiencies for our care operations team
Support our Data Science team and improve data pipelines
And here are the kinds of projects you might work on in your first few months:
Improving our initial user onboarding experience
Building internal tools to make our clinical staff more effective
Creating new interactive digital exercises for use alongside treatment
Improving developer tooling to make our whole team more productive
About you:
You're excited about improving behavioral health for children, teens, and their families
You love collaborating with team members from other departments (including product, marketing, clinical and more)
You own projects and see them through, even if that goes beyond code
You are thoughtful and empathetic in how you carry yourself, from decision making and execution, to communication and collaboration
You care about solving problems and aren't tied to particular solutions or technologies
You have experience developing software professionally (either Ruby + Rails, Python + Django or similar languages and frameworks)
Bonus points for experience with:
Healthcare stuff™, especially around insurance billing, employer integrations, clinical workflows or coaching
Doing most of the heavy lifting server side
Design chops - especially around animations and responsive UIs
Benefits + Perks:
Remote first and focused on community—we have Bright Spots with employees across the country (check out more info below) + a generous work-from-home stipend
Competitive compensation & benefits packages because we know the work you do is hard and we recognize how valuable you are, including an unlimited PTO policy + 14 paid holidays, Health, Vision, Dental, 401k, and stock options
Collaborate with diverse members across teams with weekly group learning opportunities and team breakfasts (and offsite retreats in the future!)

Digital Diagnostics is looking for a Software Engineer in Test to automate end-to-end, integration, and API testing.
Our flagship product is an artificial intelligence algorithm (‘IDx-DR’) where it is the computer, not the physician, diagnosing patients. Built on a series of patented machine learning algorithms, our FDA cleared software platform detects early signs of diabetic retinopathy, a debilitating eye disease that impacts the 30+ million people with diabetes in the US. We are using everything we’ve learned from IDx-DR to expand our artificial intelligence platform. This expansion is critically enabled by our efforts in EHR integrations, telemedicine features, platform connections, new application and analytics. Now we need to expand our team of highly skilled and motivated team members to help us change healthcare for the better.
Working for Digital Diagnostics offers you the opportunity to:
Work with world-renowned computer scientists and clinicians who are pushing the limits of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning in medicine.
Tackle complex challenges with the highest levels of execution and quality.
Deliver industry-leading solutions to world-leading healthcare providers.
Push the accessibility and equality of healthcare to new heights to improve the lives of millions of people.
Help define the architecture of a complex global healthcare IT platform.
Are you someone who:
A team player and is willing to jump into any problem
Enjoys delighting the customer
Goes all in, learns from their mistakes, and has fun doing it
4+ years of software development experience
Then apply to be our next Software Engineer in Test!
Qualifications (aka this is what we will ask about in your interview):
Very strong technical communication skills: you should be comfortable interacting with and explaining designs to everyone from customers, to the CEO, to the developers working with you
Expertise in taking lead on designing and building complex software solutions, from conception to deployment
Best practices should be second nature to you, as you will need to implement, design to and teach them
Experience in writing end-to-end, integration and API testing
Experience writing test plans
Interest in SaMD (software as a medical device – if you know, you know) and working in regulated software environments such as ISO or FDA (don’t let this scare you – we have a lot of automation).
This is a permanently remote position. We have engineers across the United States in many different time zones. We are committed to hiring the best engineers no matter where they reside, so location is not factored into compensation. But if you ever long for the comradery of a shared workspace, we have offices in Chicago, Boston and Iowa and would be happy to have you there!

Unfortunately, we are currently not able to sponsor an immigration case for employment (for example, H-1B or other employment-based immigration cases)."|2022-04-28

   Lead all aspects of the squad’s product vision, strategy, development, and execution.
    Synthesize and develop product strategy with business partners on Legal, Policy, and Trust & Safety teams.
    Work closely and collaboratively with design and engineering to build products that are effective, scalable, and easy-to-use for buyers, sellers, and agents.
    Prioritize product roadmap through continuous iteration, user research and analysis, and experimentation when appropriate.
    Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.
   
 
  Qualifications
   Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:
   Experience as a product manager (bonus: working in a regulated space), including crafting a product strategy and vision
    Success sharing timelines, trade-offs, and risks with a broad and senior leadership group.
    Proven track record of collaborating to ensure product strategy finds the right balance of moving fast and considering different perspectives.
    Passionate about solving customer problems, both internal and external.
    Experience with using both qualitative and quantitative data to make product decisions and knowing when and how to balance data with intuition.

 Quickly iterate through solutions - We move at a fast pace which requires quick iterations to find a path to a repeatable solution.
  Bee the teammate you want to work with - We work as a team, help each other and encourage each other.
  Ask questions, answer questions - You can't iterate through solutions if you don't ask the right questions which is why there is an expectation that questions should be asked. When you know the answer, being a good teammate means chiming in to get others up to speed.
  Seek ways to make an immediate impact - Be thoughtful and proactive in how you make an impact on your team. Actively look for ways to make a fast, positive impact.

  Job Description: 
   We are looking for an empathetic and engaging community builder to support CXLife, an external community for customer experience professionals growing in their careers.
  
   CXLife is funded by Simplr, and was launched in 2018. The community itself has gone through a few iterations since it started, from public events and webinars to launching a private community engagement platform at the end of 2020. While CXLife is separate from Simplr’s customer community, we hold the same belief that NOW CX is the future of customer experience and aim to support the supportive as they elevate the CX function within their organizations.
  
   This position reports to the Head of Community, and will be supported by them, a part-time Community Engagement contractor, and additional resources within the marketing team. The CXLife CM is key to the growth of the community team, and we’re excited to help them hone in on their strengths as there is plenty of opportunity within the organization.
  
   The CXLife Community Manager will be:
   Building a diverse and inclusive space for our community members to feel safe to ask questions and find the help they need
    Writing engaging content for our blog, social media, monthly newsletter, and updates within the community platform
    Welcoming new members and identifying their community goals
    Championing CXLife by communicating and presenting community learnings internally through Slack updates and at larger company meetings
    Collaborating with internal design resources to create templates, and editing them through Canva

   1-4 years experience in community management, social media, a customer-facing role, or other position that demonstrates your excitement to help others drive towards their goals
    Previous experience within the customer experience industry isn’t required, but as our community is full of CX professionals, you must be interested in diving into the CX world through listening and community interviews, research, and tapping into our internal/external resources
    A self-starter mindset - while there will be collaboration with the Head of Community and our Community Engagement contractor, there’s plenty of room to take ownership of the community experience
    A passion for being a connector - whether that’s people to people or people to resources, you’re invested in helping people succeed in whatever project they’re tackling
    Some familiarity with social media platforms preferred (currently on LinkedIn and Facebook, but open to other platforms if it’s of interest)
    Experience with standalone community platforms preferred but not required (currently on Mighty Networks)

They must apply School and classroom rules consistently and effectively; make use of preventive discipline; and effectively supervise students both in their classroom and elsewhere on School grounds.

74475bfdacb451b0|Frameworks specialist|"Overview of Position: A strong and dedicated faculty is paramount to best serving our students and families and to establishing Unity as an exemplary school. Most critically, our faculty equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to experience secondary and postsecondary success, including the desire and capacity to learn independently, think critically, and communicate proficiently. Our ENL Specialists have the privilege and responsibility of realizing these outcomes among our new English language learners.

Overview of Unity – Our Model and Approach: Unity Preparatory Charter School of Brooklyn (Unity) is a tuition-free, open-enrollment, independent charter school that offers a progressive education in the liberal arts & sciences to over 500 students in grades 6-12. As a community-based school, we proudly serve the communities of central Brooklyn in New York City. Our middle school and high school campuses are located in the neighborhoods of Bedford Stuyvesant and Williamsburg, respectively.

Unity’s mission is to empower students as scholars and citizens so they may lead fulfilling academic, personal, and professional lives. We accomplish our mission through the integration of seven key elements that serve as the backbone of our school’s design. Collectively, these elements reflect our beliefs on what makes for an exceptional secondary education in today’s world:

A Grades 6-12 College Preparatory Curriculum: a college-preparatory liberal arts and sciences program of study in mathematics, English language arts (ELA), science, and history that fosters in students the desire and capacity to learn independently, think critically, and communicate proficiently so that they are fully prepared to succeed in their postsecondary studiesExcellent Teaching: an enthusiastic faculty of expert educators who are demonstrably successful in promoting student learning, couple high expectations with high support, go above and beyond the call of duty for students as scholars and as citizens, and serve as role models for students as life-long learners and as individuals who take the utmost pride in perfecting their craftMore Time for Learning: an extended day, week, and year for academic enrichment and extracurricular activities that deepen learning and engagement, accelerate academic growth, and expose students to new pursuitsIntensive and Differentiated Academic Support: customized settings and support provided by caring specialists for remediation and acceleration, including small class sizes, integrated co-teaching, literacy interventions, after-school and weekend tutoring, as well as advanced-level course offerings at our middle school and high schoolAmple Enrichment Courses and Extra-Curricular Activities: enrichment courses in the performing arts, visual arts, computer science, and foreign languages, as well as elective clubs, athletic teams, internships, and other “beyond-the-classroom” activities that serve to reinforce what students learn in their core courses, accommodate individual student interests, and develop important professional and citizenship skills through real-world, meaningful applicationA Positive and Supportive School Culture: a culture built on a framework of Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) in which compassionate adults explicitly guide students in the following:
modeling the behaviors that contribute to a positive and productive learning environment
developing socio-emotional skills needed to be successful, including how to manage emotions, reduce stress, make healthy decisions, and learn from one’s mistakes
Active Family and Community Involvement: ample opportunities for family engagement and community service that promotes open communication, meaningful collaboration, and active involvement and service within Unity’s community and beyond
Our Recent Accomplishments: Regardless of where students are academically or otherwise as they enter our school, our focus is on accelerating growth and on cultivating long-term academic and non-academic success. This focus has reaped impressive results for our students and families in recent years. Among our accomplishments:
95% of our first two graduating classes earned their high school diploma in four years.
100% of our graduates had formal college and career plans with a college matriculation rate of 76%. This compares favorably to a 58% college matriculation rate for students in NYC.
95% of our graduates complete at least one Advanced Placement (AP) course in high school. This compares favorably with the 33% of NYC graduates who enroll in AP courses during their high school tenure.
Our students who comprise subgroups that are traditionally least effectively served by our education system, including students classified as economically disadvantaged, Black, Latino, and students with disabilities, have consistently outperformed their district and state peers on state exams and in our high school graduation rates.
Our 8th grade students have consistently outperformed their district peers in mathematics and ELA on state exams.
In holding true to our belief in providing a truly empowering education, a vast majority of our students experience the following over their seven years at Unity:
After-school extra-curricular activities, including athletics and clubs;
Formal community service initiatives;
End-of-year Roundtable presentation – a 45-minute oral presentation given to families, Unity faculty, and community members, and;
Intensive counseling in College & Career Readiness beginning in 9th grade.

   MUFG is the fifth largest bank in the world (in total assets), with a 360-year heritage steeped in capital markets and wholesale banking. Since the global bank's expansion into the United States 150 years ago, MUFG Americas has served America's retail, corporate and investment banking clients and customers. With plans to divest its retail banking proposition, Union Bank, to U.S. Bancorp in 2022, MUFG Americas will emerge as a leading financial services institution with a substantial footprint in North America and renewed focus and investment on its core products in corporate and investment banking.
  
   During this significant divestiture activity, MUFG Americas seeks to recruit a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to lead information security as the bank advances its technology modernization efforts and contends with an increasingly complex threat environment as well as regulatory landscape.
  
   Given the confluence of these critical priorities, there is a need for a seasoned CISO, who can collaborate with business and technology stakeholders to mature the information security program in support of evolving business needs in a dynamic technology environment. The CISO will translate the bank's priorities into a comprehensive information security strategy to protect the data and assets of the bank and its customers, while enabling business innovation and growth.
  
   The incoming CISO will be focused on the future potential of the business to set the strategy and lead the delivery of a world-class cybersecurity capability in collaboration with technology, risk, and business leadership. Successful candidates will position cybersecurity as a thought-partner and business enabler, while upholding the highest standard of security and compliance to protect the data and information assets of the bank and its clients.
  
   Key Responsibilities: 
  
  The CISO of MUFG Americas will have ultimate accountability and ownership for information security as it relates to MUFG America's business, as well as the secure divestiture of Union Bank to US Bancorp. Amongst other functional and leadership responsibilities, the CISO will:
  
   Assess the current state cyber organization including people, processes, and technology. Establish a strategic road map based on prioritized areas of risk to evolve the bank's information security posture from reactive to proactive. Implement target milestones and metrics to measure performance. Communicate progress, roadblocks and challenges to the board and key stakeholders.
    Update and educate the board of directors and executive team on current cyber threats, issues, and risks; provide regular status updates on initiatives and operations.
    Engage and align with technology and business partners to drive a comprehensive information security strategy and ensure information assets and technologies are appropriately protected.
    Support the overall business technology planning, providing a current knowledge and future vision of technology, systems, data and how to ensure a secure environment.
    Collaborate across business lines; empowering business leaders to take ownership and accountability for risk appetite within respective businesses, and necessary information security practices to ensure protection of business activities.
    As the bank continues their migration to the public cloud, partner with technology to implement modern security standards, specifically related to application development and delivery.
    Lead all engineering activities pertaining to the design and implementation of cybersecurity solutions, including the development and maintenance of tools, technology, and processes.
    Drive adoption and optimization of cyber tool sets for a streamlined user experience – implement appropriate controls while identifying opportunity for automation across the stack.
    As needed, provide due diligence and support for M&A activity, assess new companies and potential acquisitions for eventual onboarding as well as support streamlined divestiture activity.
    Own and continuously evolve third-party risk management practices including a formal process and framework to assess vendors, service providers and solutions to mitigate third-party risk.
    Maintain relationships and connectivity to industry peers and relevant ""three letter agencies"" to collaborate, share information and stay abreast of cyber events or topics that may impact the bank.
    Serve as a thought leader both within the bank and externally by maintaining a relentless focus on staying ahead of trends in a dynamic cyber environment.
    Develop, mentor, and manage a motivated staff of information security professionals, including hiring, training, development, and performance management.
    Recruit, lead and inspire a diverse, world-class cybersecurity team.
  
   Desired Outcomes:
   The remediation and resolution of high priority regulatory issues.
    Lead the CISO function, ensuring continuous operational stability of MUFG Americas in support of the successful, secure divestiture of Union Bank to US Bancorp.
    A long-term road map focused on the delivery of a world-class, modern information security program, with metrics to measure progress over time.
    Resiliency - not only protection of data and assets of the bank and its customers, but more importantly the ability to recover and rebuild the program in the event of cyberattack.
    The evolution of the bank's cybersecurity posture from defensive to offensive and industry leading.
  
   Qualifications:
  
   The successful candidate will have transformed and led modern cybersecurity environments in highly regulated environments, without stifling innovation or business growth. They will be skilled at influencing across the enterprise, rapidly building credibility with the board, regulators, and regional and global leadership.

    Experience operating in a highly regulated environment, ideally financial services.
