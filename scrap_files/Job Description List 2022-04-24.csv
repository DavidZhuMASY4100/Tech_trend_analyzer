    DonorsChoose engages the public in public schools by giving people a simple, accountable, and personal way to address educational inequity. In this clip, board member Stephen Colbert tells our story.
    
   
  
   To date, teachers at 83% of all the public schools in America have posted classroom project requests on our site. Projects range from paper and markers for a poetry writing unit to violins for a school recital. More than 4 million ""citizen philanthropists"" have supported such projects, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 40 million students nationwide. In all, we've generated $1 billion for learning experiences designed by our country's most dedicated public school teachers. 
    GOOD Magazine highlighted us as one of 30 Places We Want to Work, while Fast Company named DonorsChoose one of the 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World—the first time a charity has made this list. Through its dedicated team and culture, DonorsChoose earned recognition as the #1 ""Best Nonprofit to Work For"" by the Nonprofit Times. 
   
  Team Overview 
   As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose you'll answer between 60 - 100 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles. 
   You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth grade science class. And sometimes you'll have to do things like explain policies that won't make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It's not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day you'll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students! 
   In addition to this core work, sometimes you'll be assigned capacity building work as workload and time allows. This capacity-building work is defined as work that executes against a CS manager's OKRs and will be done in close collaboration with your manager, who will fully scope and define the work. This work could look like: 
  Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders. 
   Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets. 
   Update or write public-facing help content. 
   Hop on the phone to resolve a particularly gnarly issue. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it's just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!) 
   Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization. 
   Update our internal training decks or be asked to facilitate a session. 
   Add information into our knowledge management system 
   Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization. 
  The majority of your time will be dedicated to core ticket work. When time, performance, workload, and need allow, capacity-building work may be matched with you. The breakdown between core ticket work and capacity building work for a Specialist will vary as our volume fluctuates. Typically, we estimate that you can expect this breakdown of work: 
   Q1+Q2: 95% core ticket work, 5% capacity-building work 
   Q3: 90% core ticket work, 10% capacity-building work 
   Q4: 80% core ticket work, 20% capacity-building work 
   Qualifications 
  Professional. You are the face of DonorsChoose to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, productive, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don't require a ton of supervision. 
   A solid communicator. It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You will also use these skills to engage with our customers on our Equity Focus when they reach out to us. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone. 
   Thoughtful. You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think ""What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?"" You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information. 
   Productive. We have high expectations for the quantity of work that you will do each day, while maintaining an excellent quality of support. 
   Tech comfy. You'll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques. 
   A learner. You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers. This makes you flexible to change and open to feedback on your work. 
   Decisive. You'll make judgement calls and decisions based on your knowledge of our policies and processes. You have a bias toward action. You recognize you might make mistakes or occasionally say the wrong thing to a customer, but are confident in your ability to own mistakes and learn from them. 
   Resourceful. Not every question has an easy answer, but you're totally into figuring things out. You've used multiple methods to investigate and successfully discovered the answer to something tricky. (And you'll be able to tell us about this in an interview!) 
   Generous. Once you figure something out, you're excited to share the new information. You want to lend your ideas to the team and make everyone around you stronger. 
  You might also be: (not required, but let us know if this is you!) 
  A customer support pro. You already have experience providing customer support and genuinely enjoy working with people to solve problems. You're interested in a career in customer support and contributing to projects that directly impact the culture and effectiveness of Customer Support at DonorsChoose. 
   Interested in crowdfunding platforms, two-sided marketplaces, or K-12 Education. 
   A seasoned work-from-home pro. Or, in the least, committed to and eager to try it out.

    DonorsChoose engages the public in public schools by giving people a simple, accountable, and personal way to address educational inequity. In this clip, board member Stephen Colbert tells our story.
    
   
  
   To date, teachers at 83% of all the public schools in America have posted classroom project requests on our site. Projects range from paper and markers for a poetry writing unit to violins for a school recital. More than 4 million ""citizen philanthropists"" have supported such projects, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 40 million students nationwide. In all, we've generated $1 billion for learning experiences designed by our country's most dedicated public school teachers. 
    GOOD Magazine highlighted us as one of 30 Places We Want to Work, while Fast Company named DonorsChoose one of the 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World—the first time a charity has made this list. Through its dedicated team and culture, DonorsChoose earned recognition as the #1 ""Best Nonprofit to Work For"" by the Nonprofit Times. 
   
  Team Overview 
   As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose you'll answer between 60 - 100 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles. 
   You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth grade science class. And sometimes you'll have to do things like explain policies that won't make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It's not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day you'll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students! 
   In addition to this core work, sometimes you'll be assigned capacity building work as workload and time allows. This capacity-building work is defined as work that executes against a CS manager's OKRs and will be done in close collaboration with your manager, who will fully scope and define the work. This work could look like: 
  Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders. 
   Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets. 
   Update or write public-facing help content. 
   Hop on the phone to resolve a particularly gnarly issue. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it's just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!) 
   Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization. 
   Update our internal training decks or be asked to facilitate a session. 
   Add information into our knowledge management system 
   Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization. 
  The majority of your time will be dedicated to core ticket work. When time, performance, workload, and need allow, capacity-building work may be matched with you. The breakdown between core ticket work and capacity building work for a Specialist will vary as our volume fluctuates. Typically, we estimate that you can expect this breakdown of work: 
   Q1+Q2: 95% core ticket work, 5% capacity-building work 
   Q3: 90% core ticket work, 10% capacity-building work 
   Q4: 80% core ticket work, 20% capacity-building work 
   Qualifications 
  Professional. You are the face of DonorsChoose to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, productive, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don't require a ton of supervision. 
   A solid communicator. It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You will also use these skills to engage with our customers on our Equity Focus when they reach out to us. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone. 
   Thoughtful. You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think ""What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?"" You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information. 
   Productive. We have high expectations for the quantity of work that you will do each day, while maintaining an excellent quality of support. 
   Tech comfy. You'll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques. 
   A learner. You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers. This makes you flexible to change and open to feedback on your work. 
   Decisive. You'll make judgement calls and decisions based on your knowledge of our policies and processes. You have a bias toward action. You recognize you might make mistakes or occasionally say the wrong thing to a customer, but are confident in your ability to own mistakes and learn from them. 
   Resourceful. Not every question has an easy answer, but you're totally into figuring things out. You've used multiple methods to investigate and successfully discovered the answer to something tricky. (And you'll be able to tell us about this in an interview!) 
   Generous. Once you figure something out, you're excited to share the new information. You want to lend your ideas to the team and make everyone around you stronger. 
  You might also be: (not required, but let us know if this is you!) 
  A customer support pro. You already have experience providing customer support and genuinely enjoy working with people to solve problems. You're interested in a career in customer support and contributing to projects that directly impact the culture and effectiveness of Customer Support at DonorsChoose. 
   Interested in crowdfunding platforms, two-sided marketplaces, or K-12 Education. 
   A seasoned work-from-home pro. Or, in the least, committed to and eager to try it out.

  The messages we need to better convey are;
  Amazon FNSKU Labels are used by 'Fulfillment by Amazon' (FBA) and the 'FNSKU' data which is needed for the labels is available in sellers Amazon's accounts.
  Amazon labels are used on all types of items being shipped through FBA and we print/ship within 24 hours.
  For our other sections on the site, our designer creatively created imagery and design elements t o convey our messages effectively;
  IE UPC barcode section : https://www.orderbarcodes.com/select_label_type_layout.aspx?id=26&lid=1
  The message we're conveying in the Top Section is;
  UPC labels are used for all types a products/items such as; candles etc., and we print them within 24 hours.
  Here's the Amazon page we designed with our prior designer which we'd like incorporate the same flow, into current 'live' page which accepts 'Orders'; https://www.orderbarcodes.com/amazon.aspx
 Create mobile U/X for site to enable clients to use the site on their mobile devices.
 We integrated a 'proofing process' last year, and designed it to enable our clients receive text messages, and APPROVE/REJECT proofs from their phones.

     Column is looking to hire a full-time 
     Product Designer to join our Product team. The Product Designer will report directly to our CTO and should be jazzed about being the first design hire at a high-growth, early stage startup. As a Product Designer, you will be responsible for ideating, prototyping, and pushing pixel-perfect designs for engineers and collaborating with product managers to build designs that meet business needs.
     
    
  
  
   
    What You'll Do 
    First Week: You will learn about Column's mission and vision, seek to understand our product, design, and engineering processes, and begin meeting other folks on the team. We're a small company that's growing quickly, so interpersonal rapport is essential. 
     First Month: You will build out the initial structures of a design system. You will transform a product requirement document into a finalized design spec and collaborate with engineers to ship the final designs. 
     First Six Months: You will ship production-ready designs across all areas of our core product. You will own the entire design process from low-fidelity to high-fidelity design, ideating based on initial feature requirements, prototyping and interaction, and designing engineer-ready design specs. You will build structure, processes, and best practices from scratch. 
     First Year: You will build out a Column design system and design library that is scaleable as our company and design team grows. You will be an impactful founding member of a design team at a rapidly growing tech start-up that believes we have the potential to be a once in a generation company. 
    Our Ideal Candidate 
    You're looking for a remote-first role working with wildly talented people who care about their impact on local communities 
     You have experience with all stages of the design process — from ideation and user research to low- to high-fidelity mock-ups and delivering designs — and enjoy working with product managers and engineers on designs 
     You're excited to have exceptional ownership over the future of interface design at Column and embrace the fact that being the first designer on means that you will have little day-to-day guidance, support, or feedback from other designers 
     You're comfortable working on a team and in an environment that moves quickly while maintaining pixel-perfect design standards 
     You're familiar with web-first design practices, care about designing for accessibility, and have created and/or owned a design library 
     You have a strong desire to exemplify our operating principles — be worthy of trust, do the hard work, never stop learning, intentionally build community, and tell a better story 
     You have grit and really want to work with us — if you do not resemble our ideal candidate, tell us why you'd still be a great fit for this role in an optional cover letter 
    Compensation and Benefits Column is built on the belief that important information should be accessible to the public. As such, we work hard to model this behavior for potential Columnists by including our base compensation in all job descriptions and making our full benefits accessible online. 
    Base compensation of $102,000 - $120,000 commensurate with experience and level, plus stock options and 401k plan with 5% match 
     Healthcare, vision, & dental coverage for you and your dependents 
     Unlimited (and encouraged) paid time off and 16-weeks paid parental leave 
     Multiple stipends for you to invest in a home office setup and pursue wellness activities that make you feel healthy and whole 
    About Column Column is the first collaborative public notice platform helping publishers, governments and legal services work together to inform their communities. We are a remote-first public benefit corporation with an in-person headquarters in Miami, FL. 
    To us, people are everything. Our current Columnists are wildly talented people from around the globe. We support and challenge each other. We address real problems that people face in their communities. We believe that we have the potential to be a generational company that will change the world as we know it. Will you join us?

About Us:

Warby Parker was founded with a mission: to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style.

We're constantly asking ourselves how we can do more and make a greater impact—and that starts by reimagining everything that a company and industry can be. We want to demonstrate that a business can scale, be profitable, and do good in the world—without charging a premium for it. And we've learned that it takes creativity, empathy, and innovation to achieve that goal.

Since the day we launched in 2010, we've pioneered ideas, designed products, and developed technologies that help people see. We offer everything our customers need for happier eyes at a price that leaves them with money in their pockets, from designer-quality glasses and contacts to eye exams and vision tests.

Ultimately, we believe in vision for all, which is why for every pair of glasses or sunglasses we sell, a pair of glasses is distributed to someone in need through our Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.

 Geneoscopy is committed to empowering patients and providers to transform gastrointestinal health through innovative diagnostics. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, resulting in over 50,000 deaths annually in the United States.

Colonoscopies have been the gold standard for detection of colorectal cancer, but they require patients to take time off from work and to undergo an inconvenient preparation procedure, so many patients avoid them.
 Geneoscopy has developed a novel method to extract eukaryotic RNA biomarkers from stool samples.

  About the team Zillow Group is looking for a strategic, hands-on, data-driven leader to own Technical Program Management for the Transaction Management and Document Services team. Consisting of an industry-leading Transaction management SaaS product, and a brand new, internally built document management platform, our team is powering millions of buyers, sellers, and renters through innovative products!
  
   About the role
   As a pivotal member of the team, you will lead strategy decisions, technical plans, agile ceremonies, requirement gathering from internal and external partners, cross-org collaboration, project execution, and product launches.
  
   We value writing high-quality code on top of robust architecture. Our products are increasingly complex, API-driven, and built on the latest technologies. We work at all layers of our applications, from the networking stack to the UI layers within other Zillow Group’s products as an embedded solution. We take pride in intimately understanding the technical requirements and architecture of our supported teams and customers, and serve as allies during integration, iteration, and mutual feature development.
  
   We seek someone who already possesses a strong program management background, who has already demonstrated experience leading medium to large projects across 20+ teams, and who has a well-rounded technical background in current web technologies. We need a hands-on “do-er”, which means you are not only able to develop and drive high-level critical initiatives, but you can also roll up your sleeves, dig in, and get the job done.
  
   The successful candidate will anticipate bottlenecks, provide escalation management, anticipate and make tradeoffs, and balance the business needs versus technical constraints. Our TPM will own lightweight agile ceremonies for the core engineering teams you’ll partner within this role. An ability to take large, sophisticated projects and break them down into manageable pieces, develop functional specifications, then deliver them in a successful and timely manner is encouraged. Maturity, high judgment, skills, ability to influence, analytical talent, and leadership are critical to success in this role.
   Beyond being successful, individuals will thrive in this role if you relish crafting clarity from ambiguity (at a company-level scale) and you take pride in driving sophisticated cross-team programs towards a distant (and potentially constantly evolving) finish line!

Employees may live in any of the 50 US States, with limited exceptions. In certain cases, an employee in a remote-designated job may need to live in a specific region or time zone to support customers or clients as part of their role.
   In Colorado, the standard pay range for this role is $132,400.00 - $211,600.00 Annually. This range is specific to Colorado and may not be applicable to other locations.
  
   Who you are
   5+ years of Technical Program Management experience with related technologies, including leading significant cross-functional projects in mid-size or large companies
    3+ years of hands-on experience building software solutions within current industry standard technologies
    2+ years of experience leading dev teams to design/architect business software solutions
    A first-hand solid understanding of current mobile development technologies
    Sophisticated knowledge of business applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel and current project management tools
    Excellent oral and written communication skills, as well as the ability to think clearly, analyze quantitatively, problem-solve, scope technical requirements and prioritize tasks
    Strong business and technical vision
    Ability to balance multiple competing priorities in a fast-paced environment
    A deep understanding of software development in a team, and a track record of shipping software on time
    Outstanding customer relationship skills including the ability to discover the true requirements underlying feature requests, recommend alternative technical and business approaches
    Lead engineering efforts to meet bold timelines with efficient solutions
