      Applicants applying for the GS-05 must meet one of the qualification requirements listed below: 
      General Experience: 
     A. Completion of three years of general experience, one of which was equivalent to the GS-04 level, involving the analysis, explanation, application, or interpretation of laws, rules, regulations, procedures, etc. Qualifying general experience may have been gained as a law clerk, contact representative, claims examiner, voucher examiner, or similar work with a government or private employer.

     OR 
     C. Combination of education and experience. If you do not qualify based on education or experience alone, you can combine your education and experience by converting each to a percentage and then adding the percentages. To calculate this, determine your total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required; then determine your education as a percentage of the education required; then add the two percentages. The total percentages must equal at least 100 percent to qualify. 
     If you are qualifying based on education, you must submit a copy of your college transcript with your application, and if selected, an official college transcript will be required to verify education prior to employment. 
      Applicants applying for the GS-07 must meet one of the qualification requirements listed below:

     OR 
     B. Completion of 1 full year of graduate level education in law, or other administrative or management fields related to the position.

Such study may have been performed on a full-time or part-time basis. If you cannot obtain your graduate school's definition of one year of graduate study, 18 semester hours (or 27 quarter hours) should be considered as satisfying the requirement for one year of full-time graduate study. 
     OR 
     C. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university AND you meet one of the following provisions of the superior academic achievement:

      Membership in a national honor society (other than freshman honor societies) recognized by the Association of College Honor Societies.
       
     Grade point averages should be rounded to one decimal point. For example, 2.95 is rounded to 3.0, and 2.94 is rounded to 2.9.

    What You'll Do 
    First Week: You will learn about Column's mission and vision, seek to understand our product, design, and engineering processes, and begin meeting other folks on the team. We're a small company that's growing quickly, so interpersonal rapport is essential. 
     First Month: You will build out the initial structures of a design system. You will transform a product requirement document into a finalized design spec and collaborate with engineers to ship the final designs. 
     First Six Months: You will ship production-ready designs across all areas of our core product. You will own the entire design process from low-fidelity to high-fidelity design, ideating based on initial feature requirements, prototyping and interaction, and designing engineer-ready design specs.

We are a close knit and fun-loving team of seasoned financial services professionals who came together for the challenge of building a bank from scratch – and we are committed to doing it all the right way (from technology infrastructure to modern marketing to customer experience). 
  We work with the flexibility and speed of start-up. But we also have significant stability and capital from being part of the SMBC Group (Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation). SMBC is the 2nd largest bank in Japan, and the 12th largest bank in the world with operations in over 40 countries. And SMBC is committed to disrupting the US marketplace with ground-breaking products. 
  It’s the best of both worlds, and we are seeking proven marketing leaders to propel us towards national launch. We have both the ambitious growth plans and the “patient capital” necessary to execute a multi-year plan. Join us on the journey to deliver an exciting concept of evolved banking. 
  GENERAL SUMMARY: 
  Think about the last time you logged into your banking application. Did you feel engaged or happy about the experience? Have you thought about ways you could make your bank experience better? We are looking for creative minds to help us reimagine banking. Experience Designers that can help us build the next generation bank. A different bank. One that gives consumers the support they need to make better financial decisions. Although we are part of a larger organization our digital bank team is small, nimble, and fast-paced. This culture provides an opportunity to think, invent and innovate in a complex financial space. You will work closely with user researchers, experience owners, product owners, and developers to drive a design process that works back from the customer. 
  PRINCIPAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 
  Reinvent retail banking. We are building this bank from scratch which means we can leverage new technology and approaches to redefine banking. You will work closely with product, experience owners, research, and engineering to design UX across multiple financial features and elements, focusing on interaction design and customer experience. Constantly challenge the status quo. 
   Put the customer first. Always look at it from the customer’s point of view. Every experience begins with empathy and empathy begins with listening. Understand them well enough to not only meet their needs but anticipate them.

Tia has ambitious plans to scale its ""whole-woman, whole-life"" model to more than 100,000 women by 2023. We'll do this by growing virtual and in-person operations in existing and new markets while expanding its service lines to care for women throughout their entire lives - from puberty to menopause. Since launching in 2017, Tia has grown to serve thousands of women aged 18-80 with blended in-person and virtual care in New York City, Los Angeles, Phoenix and soon San Francisco.

We're building a world class team to reimagine women's healthcare. We're an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers, designers, technologists and operators who have seen firsthand how broken the healthcare system is for women. We're united by a powerful mission to enable every woman to achieve optimal health, as defined by herself, as well as a shared set of values and principles that define our business, products, and culture.

Our company values:
Health & Wellbeing: We believe that health & wellbeing is a fundamental human need and right. We prioritize the health & wellbeing of our employees and their families.
Compassion: We believe that compassion is as important as information and care itself. We imbue compassion into our care, leadership, and communication.
Individual Agency: We believe that every person has a responsibility to enact their agency for the betterment of themselves and others. We encourage all employees to call out problems and advocate for solutions.
Collaboration: We believe that collaboration engenders creativity and outsized impact more than hyper-specialized or individualistic approaches to solving problems. We believe collaboration fosters different perspectives, experiences, and skillsets.
Aspirational Thinking: We believe that aspirational thinking leads to higher quality work and transformative outcomes. We encourage all employees to think through problems and reach for solutions that raise the bar.

  Sound Designer for AAA game studio based in NYC
   Avalanche Studios is seeking a Sound Designer (SD) with heart, to join the audio team on our latest AAA project, Contraband. Challenges include working with proprietary tools including the Apex game engine and our own modular audio framework, and utilizing these tools along with the Wwise audio engine to design and implement sounds into our game in a fairly unique way. 
  By joining our team of audio developers, you’ll be taking on the responsibility of giving weight and size to the worlds our games take place in. Our ideal team member will have a healthy balance of creative and technical problem solving abilities, as both will be needed for the role.

   We rely upon our Sound Designers to:
  Utilize their talents in crafting unique sounds to give depth, weight and character to our beautiful open worlds. 
   Think abstractly about sound sources and design their sounds using a combination of field recordings, synthesized sounds, and sounds from our extensive library. 
   Collaborate with team members across disciplines to find solutions that best support quality audio. 
   Playtest regularly and help identify opportunities to improve audio quality. 
   Embrace the challenge of problem solving with proprietary tools and applications that lack the polish and limitations that come with off-the-shelf solutions
  
  Skills and experience we’re interested in:
  Experience as a sound designer 
   Wwise fluency 
   DAW proficiency (Reaper is the team’s DAW of choice) 
   Ability to give and accept feedback 
   Communicating with people across large development teams 
   Musical knowledge and a vision for interactive music is a plus! 
   Experience with any scripting language is a plus!

   At Avalanche Studios Group, we believe in elevating good developers to greatness and providing great developers with the opportunity to do the best work of their careers. 
  Care to join us?

Every day we perform a kind of alchemy, converting our clients projects from headaches to handled.

The type of person whose attention to detail is impeccable and their ability to “learn on the fly” isn’t too far behind. If you have never worked at a company where everyone brings this type of love and energy to their job, you should, it’s contagiously electric.
 At the core, that is what it takes to build an amazing startup with a bright future - it starts with a group of individuals who have a clear vision, are willing to grow together, and happy to support each other through the ups & downs of startup life.
 While we can’t offer you the highest salary ( yet ), or the best benefits package. What we can offer you is something hard to find elsewhere, creative freedom. The opportunity to bring your own unique style and flair to a challenging job in order to make it your own.

 Ambassador Labs (formerly Datawire), the cloud native developer experience leader, enables developers to code, ship, and run applications faster and easier than ever. Maker of top Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) open source projects, including Emissary-ingress and Telepresence, Ambassador Labs delivers a developer control plane for Kubernetes that integrates the development, deployment, and production infrastructure for developers and organizations worldwide including Microsoft, PTC, NVidia, and Ticketmaster. Ambassador Labs is backed by top investors including Insight Partners, Matrix Partners, Trinity Ventures, and Four Rivers Group.
 We are looking to hire engineers that care as much about empowering developers as we do and have embraced the cloud native phenomenon that is taking over the world. We strongly believe that Ambassador Labs’ success is dependent on hiring a diverse team. Diversity means a broader spectrum of opinions, ways of working and approaches to solving problems; we feel it is critical to helping drive the creativity, innovation and sound decision-making our customers love us for!
 About the JobAs an engineer at Ambassador Labs, you will be working on products aimed at drastically improving the way cloud native developers work. Your impact will be felt by thousands of users at companies like Epic Games, Microsoft, PTC, Ticketmaster, Cisco and Unity Technologies. This is a rare opportunity to join a growing team of smart and empathetic software engineers. The role is focused primarily on development of new products and services.
 We have loosely adopted Basecamp’s Shape-Up approach to development by undertaking well-shaped projects in six-week cycles. As a team, our focus is firmly on products that help users make the shift to the cloud with Kubernetes, front and center.
 Here’s a bit more insight into what your work life will be like as an engineer on the Ambassador Cloud team at Ambassador Labs:
 Our products comprise multiple services and those services are written in various languages (the best language for that particular task), but as a member of the Ambassador Cloud team you’ll work primarily in Golang and Web-components (Javascript, CSS, React).
  You’ll work on Linux or Mac: some of us work on one platform, some on the other, each choosing whichever platform makes us the most productive.
  You’ll also use your favorite IDE or editor; although we use different ones, we’re oddly free of those silly “mine is the best” discussions : ).
  You’ll work on our SaaS product as part of a distributed team building a feature, or adding integrations with other tools, or improving performance and scalability, etc., in six-week development cycles, and then you’ll cool down between cycles doing self-directed learning, improving your tools, or maybe even hacking up a demo of an exciting new idea of yours.
  You and your team will use GitHub issues and Notion to plan and track the work, Figma for UI design, Markdown for documentation, CircleCI for continuous integration, Docker Hub for the resulting images, and of course Slack and Zoom. You’ll have a weekly all-company (Zoom) meeting to stay current on all the things, but we try hard to minimize the number of scheduled meetings in order to maximize focus time.
 Note that on-call responsibility is shared among all engineers in the organization, currently one week every three months.
 About You
 You are an engineer who enjoys developing products and you consider yourself a full-stack aficionado. At the core, you are motivated by figuring out ways for developers (your people!) to own their work through the power of microservices and Kubernetes. You’re driven by understanding customers and their problems. You move with purposeful action and, most importantly, you pride yourself on execution.
 We’re looking for candidates with a strong track record of putting Golang and Javascript to use to bring products to life. Ideally, you’ve already had some direct or indirect exposure to Kubernetes and have a passion for creating WOW experiences while at the same time making continuous improvements. Have a great idea? Act on it! You don’t have to go through layers of bureaucracy to get things done at Ambassador Labs (first of all because that’s against our philosophy, and secondly because we don’t have layers of bureaucracy!).
 Ambassador Labs is a remote-friendly company with “pods” in Boston, Portland and Montreal. Our pods are a way of bridging the gap between being 100% remote and working in an office. Eventually, when it is safe to do so, we will have physical offices in each of these locations for team members to go to on a part-time basis to fuel their creativity through brainstorming and watercooler conversations. This is our way of creating the best of both worlds. For now, everyone is 100% remote.
 How to Apply
 We are looking forward to hearing from you. We move quickly and decisively. We don’t need to talk to 20 other candidates to make a decision, so if the fit feels right on both sides, you can be part of the team as soon as next week! The first step is speaking to our People Person, followed by the engineering leadership, and then a few of your future colleagues/team members. Interviews are typically 30 - 45 minutes, all remote. We’ll talk through your background, your approach to work, and dive into your technical knowledge. No algorithms, no off-the-cuff coding sessions, or brainteasers: we want to hear about your real-life experience and successes, especially the users that you’ve made happy.
 This is a demanding application process and a significant career move that’s well worth considering. We appreciate you giving us that consideration, and we promise to give you our full attention in return. Talk to you soon!

The Onboarding Consultant role is responsible for managing a book of business (80+ restaurants) within their assigned Region. They are expected to work autonomously under an Onboarding manager to complete expected goals for numbers of projects taken live per month, self managing and prioritizing what they work on based on customer need and Toast requirements.

The Implementation Consultant I must be comfortable with ambiguity and work flexibly in a business with aggressive growth goals. Leveraging their Toast product knowledge and project management skills, the Onboarding Consultant will partner with restaurant owners in order to build out a onboarding plan that will produce a high quality implementation experience within timeline and budget constraints.

Project Management (30%): Leveraging their strong project management skills, the Onboarding Consultant will manage several onboarding engagements simultaneously. Effective time management is an essential skill for all Onboarding Consultants as they are responsible for a large book of onboarding business and the restaurant industry is significantly time constrained.

Post Live Relationship Management (10%): As the client is transitioned over into the post-onboarding phase of the customer journey, the Onboarding Consultant is expected to ensure this transition goes smoothly and therefore is available to assist and guide the customer during their first several days of usage by providing guidance through questions or troubleshooting problems. This could take place in the form of email correspondence, sending additional educational resources, or holding follow-up training.
